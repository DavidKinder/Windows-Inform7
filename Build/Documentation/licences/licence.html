<p>Inform for Windows contains several components, aggregated together to

sold for profit if so desired, without the need for royalty payment, provided that it prints
a game banner conforming to the standard library's banner at an early stage in play: in
particular, this banner must contain the information that the story file was compiled by
Inform, and the version numbers of compiler and library used.
