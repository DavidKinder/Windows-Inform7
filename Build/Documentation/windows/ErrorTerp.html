<p>
The application compiled and ran your source text, but the resulting game caused the interpreter to fail. This should never happen.
</p><p>
There have been cases reported of this occurring when anti-virus software has interfered with the operation of the interpreter. If your anti-virus
software brings up any messages about blocking something when the game is run, this may be the cause of the problem.
