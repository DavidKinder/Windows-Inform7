<p>Inform in 2015 includes several hundred bug fixes as compared with the 2014 releases. The language has only changed in minor ways, but the Inform app can now be used to make Extension projects as well as stories, and the old Skein and Transcript panels are merged into a new one called Testing.</p>

<p>If you haven't used Inform since before 2014, though, there are big changes. The application was considerably enhanced, for one thing, but the changes go deeper than that. Here are just the headlines:</p>

<p>Firstly: the old &quot;Materials&quot; folder has been renamed &quot;.materials&quot;. So if your project is called &quot;Dream.inform&quot; then it's accompanied by &quot;Dream.materials&quot;, not &quot;Dream Materials&quot; as before.</p>

<p>Secondly: the language has much better handling of text, getting rid of &quot;indexed&quot; text entirely, and providing grammatical adaptation - the ability to turn &quot;You go out&quot; automatically into &quot;They went out&quot;, for example. There's also real number support with scientific functions (so you can perform physical calculations and have Inform check the dimensions, for example); there are named constants; there's a new ability for projects to have their own private Extensions; and so on.</p>

<p>Thirdly: a whole pile of phrases which have been deprecated since before 2010 have finally been removed from the language. If you're still using any of those, you'll need to reword them.</p>
