<p>
The application compiled and ran your source text, but the interpreter for the resulting game failed to start. This should never happen.
</p><p>
There have been cases reported of this occurring when anti-virus software has incorrectly labelled the interpreters as malware, or infected with a virus.
If you check in the <b>Interpreters</b> directory under where Inform is installed (which is usually <b>C:\Program Files\Inform</b>), then there should
be three files: <b>frotz.exe</b>, <b>git.exe</b> and <b>glulxe.exe</b>. If any of these are missing, this will be the cause of this problem, and you
should check whether your anti-virus software has incorrectly quarantined any of these files.
