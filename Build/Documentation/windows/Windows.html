<title>Notes on the Windows version of Inform 7</title>
</head>
<body><font><h3>Windows Inform 7</h3>
<p>
<p>This Windows version of Inform 7 was created by David Kinder, based on a design by Graham Nelson and Andrew Hunter.
<p>
<h4>Windows Defender</h4>
If you are running Windows Defender (or Microsoft Security Essentials, as it was previously known) then you will find that
Inform 7 can be very slow to compile and to search documentation. The problem is that Windows Defender insists on scanning
every HTML file that applications open or create. The only solution to this is, if possible, to configure Windows Defender
to ignore either all the executables in the Inform 7 installation directory, or to ignore all the directories containing
Inform projects, as well as the "Inform" directory under "My Documents", and the Inform 7 installation directory.
<p>
<h4>Shortcuts</h4>
The following keyboard shortcuts are available:
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign=top><font size=2><strong>F1</strong></font></td>
    <td><font size=2>Show the documentation index: this is the same as the "Inform Help" item on the "Help" menu.</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign=top><font size=2><strong>F2</strong></td>
    <td><font size=2>Switch the keyboard focus to the search source field on the toolbar.</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign=top><font size=2><strong>F3</strong></td>
    <td><font size=2>Switch the keyboard focus to the search documentation field on the toolbar.</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign=top><font size=2><strong>F4</strong></td>
    <td><font size=2>Show the whole of the source text in the Source tab. This is equivalent to bringing
up the Contents view and clicking on the very top heading.</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign=top><font size=2><strong>F5</strong></font></td>
    <td ><font size=2>Build the game and run it: this is the same as the "Go" toolbar command.</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign=top><font size=2><strong>F6</strong></font></td>
    <td><font size=2>Switch the keyboard focus to the opposite pane.</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign=top><font size=2><strong>F7</strong></font></td>
    <td><font size=2>Build the game but do not run it: this is the same as the "Refresh Index" item on the
"Play" menu.</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap valign=top><font size=2><strong>F9</strong></font></td>
    <td><font size=2>Build the game and replay to the current position in the skein: this is the same as the
"Replay" toolbar command.</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
When viewing the contents pane, shift-clicking on a section heading will show the entire source pane with the
clicked section heading in view, rather than showing only that section.
<p>
<h4>Dictionaries</h4>
<p>
To install a new dictionary language for spell-checking, download the appropriate dictionary from 
<a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/tree/">LibreOffice</a>.
Copy the ".aff" and ".dic" files into the "Dictionaries" sub-directory of your Inform 7 installation. Re-start
Inform 7 and open the spell-checker: your new dictionary should be included in the drop-down list of languages.
<p>
<h4>Home Directory</h4>
<p>
The directory that Inform uses to store extensions, documentation, etc. (which defaults to the user's "My Documents"
folder) can be changed by creating a text file "home.txt" in the same directory as the Inform executable,
containing the path to the required home directory.
<p>
<h4>Inform 6</h4>
The bundled Inform 6 compiler is generally the latest release, though sometimes it proves necessary to use a version
of Inform 6 with further patches beyond the latest release. There is an active
<a href="https://github.com/DavidKinder/Inform6">GitHub Inform 6 project</a>
which contains the revisions of the Inform 6 compiler used.
