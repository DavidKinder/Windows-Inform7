<p>Inform projects are traditionally accompanied by folders of resources: thus, &quot;Example.inform&quot; would be accompanied by &quot;Example Materials&quot;. From 2014, this folder is now called &quot;Example.materials&quot; instead.</p>
<p>This was a change imposed on us by Apple's sandboxing security requirements: we would otherwise have been unable to have Inform available at the Mac App Store. But it applies across all platforms.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s2"></a>§5.2. Inform on Mac OS X</p>
<p>Andrew Hunter's original Inform application for OS X has been substantially rewritten and refined by Toby Nelson, who takes over as its maintainer from this build. Much work has been undertaken to modernise the application, to make it more stable, consistent, user friendly, and feature-rich. This was also an opportunity to introduce new features to Inform's &quot;reference design&quot; for the first time in some years, features which we hope to bring to Inform's other platforms later.</p>
<p>The price for this is that Inform runs only on Snow Leopard 10.6.8 or later, which means that it requires an Intel-processor Mac for the first time. That includes almost every computer manufactured by Apple in the last eight years, but we know it will leave a few Inform users out, and we're sorry for that. The rapid pace of change in Apple's operating systems is such that it has become difficult to have any kind of good user experience on 10.9 while still functioning on 10.5.</p>
<p>Mac App Store: Inform is now code-signed, i.e., digitally authenticated as being the work of an identifiable developer, and this means that Gatekeeper, the Apple security system in OS 10.8 and 10.9, no longer advises the user that the app is potentially dangerous to run. Inform is also sandboxed, which gives the user the assurance that it cannot access private data or make illicit communications. Our intention is to offer Inform both as a direct download from inform7.com (for OS 10.6.8 or later) and on the Mac App Store (for OS 10.8.3 or later), in versions which are identically featured and, of course, both free. Inform's App Store debut will be in a few weeks' time. This should be a help for users in education, where school IT departments are wary of allowing teaching staff to download apps from non-trusted sources.</p>
<p>Design: Inform now has a new clean modern look, with new application icons, document icons, toolbar buttons, images, and Retina screen support. It provides a full-screen mode for users of 10.7 or later (suggestion 3011916). The centrepiece of the toolbar is now a status window like the one used by Xcode and iTunes: this displays the task currently progressing, or the task most recently completed, and can control whether the story is running.</p>
<p>Launcher: Inform used to provide a three-button splash screen, but this has been replaced by a much more feature-rich &quot;launcher&quot; window. This can be toggled open or closed with Command-L: is shows a list of recent projects, lets you open or create new projects and extensions, provides sample projects for new users to play with, has links to useful resources and advice, and so on.</p>
<p>Search: The previous find systems have been replaced with more modern and feature-rich &quot;Find&quot; and &quot;Find in Files&quot; dialogs. &quot;Find&quot; (Command-F) searches the current page (whatever currently has focus). &quot;Find in Files&quot; (Command-Shift-F) is similar to &quot;Find&quot;, but searches across chosen locations: Source, Extensions, Documentation (Main text, Examples, Phrase definitions) in any combination. Two search gadgets on the toolbar, one for source, one for documentation, provide quick access to this. Shortcuts are standardised, e.g. Shift-Command-G is now the shortcut for &quot;Find Previous&quot;. Search results are much better displayed and sorted (for example, results in the Recipe Book are tinted yellow) and clicking on them jumps more accurately to their location. Documentation search is carefully scoped to search only what's relevant. Finally, both &quot;Find&quot; and &quot;Find in Files&quot; offer fully-featured regular expression search and replace.</p>
<p>Editing: A new text and syntax-highlighting engine has made syntax colouring and styling more accurate, much faster and less prone to crashing or hanging.</p>
<p>Extensions: A new pane, &quot;Extensions&quot;, details what extensions are installed, and offers the new Public Library. This compares versions of extensions available at the Inform website against the installed extensions: it shows what's new and what needs updating. Updates and new installations can be made with a single click, or extensions can be installed en masse, with options to download all items or update all outdated versions.</p>
<p>Preferences: The app Preferences are much more clearly laid out, and give a fuller range of options on syntax colouring and styling.</p>
<p>These are the main highlights, but there are small enhancements throughout, and we suggest making a general tour.</p>
<p>(Suggestions 876091, 860939, 3011916, 839957, 846303, 847455, 789525 and probably others, too.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s3"></a>§5.3. Inform for Windows</p>
<p>Elastic tabstops are now available as an option in the Format menu. When elastic tabstops are enabled, tabstops are automatically sized so that columns in tables line up.</p>
<p>The font settings are now respected in the HTML based panes (that is, the index, errors and documentation) when Internet Explorer 9 is installed.</p>
<p>The front-end attempts to sensibly replace spaces with tabs in text that is pasted or dropped on the source tab: if a table is detected its elements are separated by tabs, and leading spaces are also converted to tabs.</p>
<p>The Glulx interpreters in the game tab now support the additions to Glk in versions 0.7.1, 0.7.2 and 0.7.3 of the Glk specification.</p>
<p>The front-end now calls the Inform 6 compiler with the 'k' switch, which enables generation of the Infix debugging information file.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000659) whereby the extensions menu could show only 200 installed extensions; it can now show 1000.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000859) whereby the Save As... menu item, although available during the time when a story is being compiled, didn't work properly then.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000919) whereby whitespace is sometimes trimmed when material is cut and pasted in the source text.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000733) whereby changing font to an exotically encoded font (e.g. for music notation) could in some circumstances crash the interface.</p>
<p>When editing the blessed Transcript, the effect of Enter and Ctrl+Enter has been reversed: the former puts in a carriage return, the latter ends editing. (See bug 0000532.)</p>
<p>There is now an Edit &gt; Headings menu item for navigating the source when it's showing only one heading's-worth. (See bug 0000540.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s4"></a>§5.4. Inform for Linux</p>
<p>The Transcript pane has arrived. This means that the Gnome front-end finally has all the same major features as the OS X and Windows front-ends. Also, finishing the Transcript led to many small bug fixes in the Skein, both structural and cosmetic.</p>
<p>The Spanish translation of the interface has been kindly updated as of 2012 by Jhames Bolumbero, and Stéphane Aulery has contributed a French translation.</p>
<p>The &quot;indent wrapped lines&quot; feature from the OS X and Windows front-ends has been added. This makes it easier to read the Story code when entire paragraphs are indented.</p>
<p>Inform project folders are now displayed in the file manager with Inform icons instead of regular folder icons, and the Materials folder has its own icon as well.</p>
<p>Instead of Ctrl+(Alt+)Left and Ctrl+(Alt+)Right for navigating between sections, the shortcuts now use the , and . keys as in the OS X front-end, so as not to conflict with the well-known Ctrl+Left and Ctrl+Right shortcuts for jumping to the next or previous word.</p>
<p>Matteo Settenvini contributed an improvement where application settings are stored using the Gnome platform's newer GSettings API, rather than the obsolete GConf which caused some problems (e.g. bug 0000600).</p>
<p>Attempted to make the program's error messages more understandable and clearer about how to solve the error.</p>
<p>Sound effects now play correctly in the Game panel, when playing a Glulx project which contains them. (See bug 0000464.)</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000483) whereby editing extensions might lead to corruption.</p>
<p>Bugs fixed (0000678, 0000717) to improve the refresh speed of the Skein display when there's a large skein; bug fixed (0000677) to do with labels appearing in the wrong places.</p>
<p>Bugs fixed (0000522, 0000692) in the Extension installation process.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000529) whereby HTML links in Glulx games did not always work in the Game panel.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000653) whereby story files released in unblorbed form would incorrectly have Strict Debug checking left on.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000654) whereby the setting for the user's preferred glulx interpreter would sometimes be forgotten when Gnome Inform was quit and then restarted.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000676) whereby Find and Replace didn't get case sensitivity correct.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000681) whereby the interface would hang on reloading a source text which had been edited and saved in some other application while also open in Gnome Inform. Also, moved the notification displayed when this happens to the status bar, in order to be less intrusive.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000691) whereby the interface might crash if a Glulx project being played tried (in error) to use a picture which did not exist.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000702) changing &quot;Elastic Tabs&quot; to &quot;Elastic Tabstops&quot; as per the request of elastic tabstops' inventor, Nick Gravgaard.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000725) whereby the Contents tab displayed the headings hierarchy with incorrect structural indentation.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0000731) whereby Gnome Inform crashed when changing the panel in which the Game ran, under some circumstances.</p>
<p>When opening a project which has been renamed so that the folder name no longer ends with &quot;.inform&quot;, Gnome Inform now offers to put the &quot;.inform&quot; back again. (See bug 0000738.)</p>
<p>Bug fixed whereby Gnome Inform crashed when the debug log was not available to open. (Discovered through bug 0000999.)</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001087) whereby a failure in opening a project from the welcome splash screen would quit the application instead of returning to the splash screen.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001109) whereby Gnome Inform crashed when encountering an empty directory in the user's installed extensions area.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001123) whereby Gnome Inform crashed when running a story where input was entered in more than one Glulx window.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001135) whereby Gnome Inform occasionally crashed when starting a story.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001187) whereby Glulx text effects persisted from one run of a story to the next.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001206) whereby headings surrounded by whitespace-only lines (rather than empty lines) were not included in the Contents pane.</p>
<p>The default spellchecking language is now English, rather than the user's system language. (See bug 0001209).</p>
<p>Bug fixed whereby Gnome Inform crashed when there was an error opening a project, instead of displaying an error message.</p>
<p>Bug fixed whereby Gnome Inform crashed when encountering an unknown command line option.</p>
<p>Bug fixed whereby the Documentation pane didn't load on the left-hand side.</p>
<p>Bug fixed whereby &quot;paste code&quot; icons on the Index pages didn't paste any code.</p>
<p>Bug fixed whereby closing the welcome splash screen did not quit the application.</p>
<p>In addition, many minor and cosmetic bug fixes to the build process, and removed legacy code that was required for compatibility with the now obsolete Debian Lenny operating system.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s5"></a>§5.5. Inform for Command-Line Linux</p>
<p>The number of supported architectures has dropped to four: Linux on x86_64, i386, ppc (32-bit), and arm6hf (e.g. Raspberry Pi). There are no longer ports to s390 or s390x, no armv5tel, and no Solaris support. There are no more separate downloads for the various architectures, either: the single I7_6L01_Linux_all.tar.gz is universal.</p>
<p>The Cheesy Perl IDE has been updated in the following ways:  Any files found in the Extensions directory which lack an .i7x extension will have one added. Any project &quot;Whatever Materials&quot; folder will be renamed &quot;Whatever.materials&quot;. Inform will no longer compile to z5 or z6; existing games using either of those settings will have their compilation targets changed to z8.</p>
<p>A bug identified by Simon Andersson, where i7 couldn't find its components if installed to a non-default location, has been fixed.</p>
