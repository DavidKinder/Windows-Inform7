<p>By default, Inform gives the player character (and every other person) a simple unitary body, one without hands or feet or any other defined parts. In many games this is adequate; but in others it is not enough, and we may want to endow all people with some more specific physical features, as in</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s3"></a>§5.3. Characterization</p>
<p>Much of the personality of the player character in IF emerges from what he can and cannot (or will and will not) do; part of the pleasure of playing a character arises from this opportunity for role-playing and role-exploration. Some characters are consciousless daredevils, willing to jump off cliffs, crawl through narrow gaps, and rob widows if the player commands it; others are repressed neurotics who barely dare to speak to other characters or touch anything that doesn't belong to them.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Finishing School</span> and <span class="boldface">Dearth and the Maiden</span> both treat the case of a character constrained by good manners and a sense of polite society: the former forbids only one action, while the latter condemns a whole range of them.</p>
<p>Constraining the character is only the half of it: we might also want to think about what sorts of unusual actions that character might be especially likely to take, and account for these. Of course, major actions that affect the story world will require some thought and implementation work, and we should consider carefully before making the player a character like, say, the Noble of Glamour, a spirit in human form who can charm all comers, transform bespectacled secretaries into divas, and cause spontaneous cloudbursts of scarlet glitter.</p>
<p>But even simple humans have some characteristic traits and gestures. We will probably want to write some characteristic reaction to EXAMINE ME, as demonstrated in <span class="boldface">Bad Hair Day</span>. We might provide a few pieces of clothing or props that aren't strictly critical in the story, like a policeman's helmet or a feather boa:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11114" -->
<a id="c11114"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player is wearing a policeman's helmet.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can liven up the interactive aspect of characterization if we give the player a little scope for role-playing: this may mean responding to gestures, like</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11115" -->
<a id="c11115"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;bite nails&quot; as a mistake (&quot;Your only nail remaining is the one on your left thumb, and you're saving it for the AP Calculus exam.&quot;).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Of course, we would need to have hinted to the player that nail-biting is characteristic of his character.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s4"></a>§5.4. Background</p>
<p>In IF, as in all interactive storytelling, an essential problem is that the player does not begin the story knowing everything that the player character should, and so may implausibly bumble through situations that the player character should be quite comfortable in. If the player character has friends, an unusual job, a home or environment we're not familiar with, a secret past, these will all be a blank to the player.</p>
<p>Some games get around this by making the player character an amnesiac, or positioning him as a newcomer to a strange world in which his disorientation is explicable; but there are stories that cannot be told this way, and so we need other methods of getting the player to know what the player character already does.</p>
<p>Our first opportunity to inform the player about the player character is in the opening text of a story:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11116" -->
<a id="c11116"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;The funeral is exactly a month ago now, but Elise's shoes are still on the shoe tree.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We may also want to write descriptions of objects to give extra background information the first time the player encounters them:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11117" -->
<a id="c11117"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A thing can be examined or unexamined. A thing is usually unexamined. After examining something: now the noun is examined; continue the action.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c11118" -->
<a id="c11118"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The description of the newspaper is &quot;A rolled-up newspaper[if unexamined], and thus a symbol of your newly-single state: Elise always had it open and the Local Metro section next to your plate by the time you got out of the shower[end if].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>To expand on this, we could give the player a THINK ABOUT or REMEMBER command, with which he can call up information about people he meets or references he encounters in descriptions, so that he could (for instance) next type REMEMBER ELISE. <span class="boldface">Merlin</span> demonstrates one way to implement a character with memory; <span class="boldface">One of Those Mornings</span> puts a twist on this by letting the player FIND things which he knows his character possessed at some time before the story started.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s5"></a>§5.5. Memory and Knowledge</p>
<p>All of us carry around in our heads an (incomplete, imperfect) model of the world around us: an idea of where we left the keys, whether the oven is on or off, how many clean pairs of socks are left in the drawer, what we look like in our best pair of jeans. The differences between that mental model and reality are to some degree a reflection of personal character: our forgetfulness, our wishful thinking, our innocence or cynicism.</p>
<p>By default, Inform does not keep track of the player character's knowledge (or any other character's knowledge, for that matter) as a separate thing from the model world, relying on descriptive prose rather than modeling to introduce these quirks of characterization.</p>
<p>All the same, there are often times when we would like to keep track of discrepancies between the world model and the narrator's mental model. Perhaps the most common way to do this is simply to mark everything that the player encounters as &quot;seen&quot; when the player first examines it, thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11119" -->
<a id="c11119"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A thing can be seen or unseen.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c11120" -->
<a id="c11120"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Carry out examining a thing:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the noun is seen.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>or -- to have things remembered from the first moment they're mentioned in a room description:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11121" -->
<a id="c11121"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing the name of something (called the target):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the target is seen.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The mental model need not always be accurate, of course. We might, for instance, have occasion to keep track of where the player character last saw something, even if the object has since been moved; or keep track of falsehoods the player character has been told in conversation; or make the player refer to a character as &quot;the bearded man&quot; until he is properly introduced.</p>
<p>Included with Inform is the extension Epistemology, by Eric Eve, which provides one way of tracking this kind of information. Epistemology distinguishes between items that the player character has seen, because they're objects in a room the player has been to, and items that are familiar to the player for other reasons, such as a quest item he knows about but hasn't found yet, or an abstract conversation topic. Anything that is either seen or familiar is counted as &quot;known&quot;.</p>
<p>Modeling what the player does and does not know is only half the job, of course: we also need that information to affect the behavior of the story in plausible ways.</p>
<p>One obvious occasion to use player character knowledge is in the output of descriptions. We might want to respond to actions differently depending on what the player has previously done, as in <span class="boldface">Tense Boxing</span>, or change the way we describe objects in light of new knowledge about them, as in <span class="boldface">Zero</span>. <span class="boldface">Casino Banale</span> takes that idea much further, with a whole system of facts that can be narrated to the player in a somewhat flexible but interdependent order, as the player looks at relevant objects or notices them in room descriptions.</p>
<p>Along similar lines, we may want an object to change its name for the player depending on what the player knows. That name change should affect both what Inform displays and what it understands about the object. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11122" -->
<a id="c11122"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
An Amherz Amulet is a thing. It can be known or unknown. It is privately-named.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c11123" -->
<a id="c11123"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The printed name is &quot;[if known]Amherz Amulet[otherwise]lizard-shaped pewter charm[end if]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c11124" -->
<a id="c11124"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c11125" -->
<a id="c11125"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;amherz&quot; or &quot;amulet&quot; as the Amulet when the Amulet is known.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c11126" -->
<a id="c11126"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;lizard&quot; or &quot;lizard-shaped&quot; or &quot;pewter&quot; or &quot;charm&quot; as the Amulet when the Amulet is unknown.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c11127" -->
<a id="c11127"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; say &quot;You rub off a bit of the dirt, and... what do you know? It's actually the priceless and fabulously powerful Amherz Amulet!&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; now the Amherz Amulet is known.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Finally, the player's knowledge may affect how the story interprets commands, in the determining what is called &quot;scope&quot;. When Inform tries to make sense of something the player has typed, it makes a list of everything that the player is allowed to refer to at the moment, and then checks whether all of the objects in the player's command refer to items in that list. Only things that are &quot;in scope&quot; are open for discussion.</p>
<p>If the player mentions an object that is not &quot;in scope&quot; -- say, a red hat left behind in the next room -- Inform will issue the response &quot;You can't see any such thing.&quot; This is also Inform's reply if the player mentions a nonsense object (&quot;EXAMINE FURSZWIGGLE&quot;) or an object that does not exist in the story world at all (&quot;EXAMINE CELL PHONE&quot; in a story set in Carolingian France).</p>
<p>This is not the only possible way for interactive fiction to handle such communication. Some games will respond differently to EXAMINE RED HAT and EXAMINE FURSZWIGGLE, saying in the first case something like &quot;You can't see that now&quot; and in the second &quot;I don't know the word 'furszwiggle'.&quot;</p>
<p>The drawback of such behavior is that the player can make premature discoveries. If he hasn't found a sword yet, but thinks there may be a sword later in the story, he can type EXAMINE SWORD and see from the response whether his guess is correct. Nonetheless, there are people who prefer this alternative exactly because it does expose the limits of the story's understanding, preventing fruitless attempts to use a word that is not recognized at all. If it is desirable, there is an extension that will reproduce this behavior in Inform as well.</p>
<p>Using Inform's default behavior, however, scope is an ad-hoc way of keeping a list of things that are common knowledge between the story and the player. The player knows many things that the story might not (like what a cell phone is); the story knows a few things the player may not (like the fact that there is a sword in an as-yet unvisited room). Neither of those things can fruitfully enter into commands because they have no mutually agreed-upon referent.</p>
<p>By default, Inform assumes that &quot;scope&quot; includes only those things that are currently visible by line of sight. This works pretty well for a wide range of situations, but there are still plenty of occasions when we want to admit that the story and the player share a knowledge of things not seen. GO TO THE KITCHEN might be a useful command even when the player can't currently view the kitchen. ASK FRED ABOUT THE FOOTPRINTS should perhaps work even when the footprints are far away in the garden. SMELL STINKY CHEESE might need to work even when the cheese is invisibly locked away in a porous container but is exuding a stench. In a dark room, the player can't see his own inventory, but he should still remember that he's carrying it and be able to mention it. And sometimes we might want the story to acknowledge that the player is referring to an object that he has seen somewhere, even if that thing is now out of sight.</p>
<p>In practice, we have two ways to tinker with scope: we can change the scope for a specific command, using a token with any, as in</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11128" -->
<a id="c11128"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;go to [any room]&quot; as approaching.
<br />Understand &quot;find [any thing]&quot; as finding.
<br />Understand &quot;ask [someone] about [any known thing]&quot; as interrogating it about.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Or we can add areas and items to scope for all commands, as in</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11129" -->

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s6"></a>§5.6. Viewpoint</p>
<p>Inform automatically creates a character for the player - a bland, personality-free entity at the outset, as we've seen. But there is no reason why the player need stick to this same identity throughout the story. Conventional fiction often jumps from one viewpoint character to another, and so can IF.</p>
<p>To do this at the most elementary level, we simply at some point</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11130" -->
<a id="c11130"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
now the player is Janine;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>where Janine is a person we've already defined in the code. Now the player is in whatever location Janine inhabits, carries whatever Janine carries, and wears whatever Janine is wearing. <span class="boldface">Terror of the Sierra Madre</span> shows off this effect, and also demonstrates how to make the command prompt remind the player which character he currently controls. Some games instead give this information in the status line or after the name of the location when looking, producing output like</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11131" -->
<a id="c11131"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Bottomless Acherousia (as Charon)
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We could do the same by adding a line such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11132" -->
<a id="c11132"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After printing the name of a room while constructing the status line or looking:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[roman type] (as [the player])&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Of course, we'll need a good deal of other work to make Janine a distinct person from whichever character the player was before. The distinction may come from changed capabilities of the new character, which we can express through new rules about actions; e.g.,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11133" -->
<a id="c11133"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of listening when the player is Janine:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Your childhood accident left you unable to hear any but the loudest noises. Currently there is only silence.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Janine may also have new, different perspective on her surroundings, expressed through the descriptions of the things she looks at; <span class="boldface">Uncommon Ground</span> makes a &quot;by viewpoint&quot; token for text alternatives, allowing us to tag our descriptions to indicate which variations should be shown to which viewpoint characters. <span class="boldface">The Crane's Leg 1</span> and <span class="boldface">2</span> offer more elaborate and specialized ways of customizing the player character's observations to depend on how he relates (physically and in attitude) to the things around him.</p>
<p>If we want to change the tense and person of narration from the conventional present second person, we may do this as well:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11134" -->
<a id="c11134"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the story viewpoint is first person plural;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the story tense is past tense.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Though this only changes the form of the text produced automatically by Inform (responses such as &quot;you can't go that way&quot; might become, say, &quot;I couldn't go that way&quot;), and all author-written text in the story must be written in the tense and person intended.</p>

<p>And that's it, as far as the find command goes. The rest is local color.</p>

<p>The past (&quot;if the box was...&quot;) and past perfect (&quot;if the box had been...&quot;) are especially useful for cases where we want to report on an action after the state of the item has changed; so, for instance:</p>

<a id="c11274_377"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the box had not been carried by the player, say &quot;You lift the mysterious box for the first time.&quot;;

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This is in many respects similar to a rule beginning &quot;After taking the mysterious box for the first time...&quot;, but it is superior in most circumstances, for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, it will respond correctly even if the player has somehow carried the box before without taking it explicitly: for instance, if another character gave him the box, if the box were moved into his inventory as a result of another action, or if the player carried the box at the start of play. Inform begins its reckoning of time when the game begins, so if the box is defined as being open at the outset, &quot;if the box has been open&quot; will always be true.</p>
<p>Second, &quot;after taking... for the first time&quot; fires only the first time the player attempts to take something. If the player tried to take the box, failed, and then tried again later, the &quot;for the first time...&quot; rule would not fire; our &quot;if the box has not been carried...&quot; rule would.</p>

<p>In a work of interactive fiction that involves many new discoveries, we might want to change the way we narrate room descriptions and describe objects as the player learns new information.</p>
<p>One approach to this is to create a model of the facts we want the player to find out, and attach some narrative text to each. When a fact becomes relevant to the story, that narrative text is shown to the player. So:</p>

<p>Now, we also need a way to tell Inform to introduce certain new facts when the right previous ones have been introduced. We'll create a &quot;following&quot; relation, according to which a new fact can be told to the player when the player has already learned all the facts it follows. This way, we can simulate the effect of putting together several pieces of evidence to come to a conclusion:</p>

<p>So far, we have generally dealt with cases where the property of a thing can be a number (such as 3), a value (such as brightness), or a unit (like height, here). It is also possible for a thing to have a property which names another thing, as in &quot;The mother of the baby trout is the large trout&quot; -- where &quot;mother&quot; is a property, and its value, in the case of the baby trout, is large trout. We would define such a property with a line such as &quot;A fish has a thing called the mother.&quot;</p>
<p>In practice, though, this is a bit confusing as syntax; moreover, Inform has a much more powerful construct for talking about the ways in which one object relates to another object.

<p>Now each of these types has one ideal representative which has the fundamental attributes of its kind: the ordinary chair is the most chairlike chair imaginable, the ordinary table is the epitome of tableness, and so on.

<p>So far the effect is not very deep, but we could take the auto-description a great deal further: providing a larger and more interesting set of variations; or writing a complicated set of rules such that the player only notices height variations when carrying a ruler; or switching between several player-characters, each of whom notices a different subset of characteristics. But these refinements would require more input from later chapters.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a game where we want the player to control two different characters, swapping bodies from one turn to the next. First, the setting, and the two people who will alternately play:</p>

<a id="c11366_407"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Teresa is a woman in the Hay-Strewn Corridor. &quot;Teresa stands opposite you[if Teresa carries something], her fingers wrapped tightly around [a list of things carried by Teresa][end if].&quot; Teresa carries a bulb of garlic and a cross.

Maleska is a man in the Hay-Strewn Corridor. &quot;Maleska watches you from eyes entirely black.&quot; Maleska carries a skull.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If we tried the text above in Inform, we would find ourselves in the Hay-Strewn Corridor and confronted by both Teresa and Maleska. If &quot;player&quot; is not set to any named person, Inform creates a bland person called &quot;yourself&quot; to represent the player. To avoid this, we set &quot;player&quot; to the person we want to begin as. The player character is normally privately-named, so we'll need to make sure &quot;Maleska&quot; still means what it should.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11368_407" -->
<a id="c11368_407"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player is Maleska. Understand &quot;Maleska&quot; as Maleska.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now the Corridor contains just two people, and we arrive on the scene as Maleska, with only Teresa facing us.</p>
<p>At the end of every turn we will use the 'now the player is...' phrase. (This looks as if it simply changes the value of &quot;player&quot;: which it does, but it also carries out a complicated operation behind the scenes to effect the switch.)</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11369_407" -->
<a id="c11369_407"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player is Maleska, now the player is Teresa;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;otherwise now the player is Maleska.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Our two characters already see the Corridor differently, but let's differentiate them further:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11370_407" -->
<a id="c11370_407"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every person has a number called strength. The strength of Teresa is 3. The strength of Maleska is 5.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In this small example, strength is not used for anything, except that we will display it on the status line:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11371_407" -->
<a id="c11371_407"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the command prompt is &quot;[bold type][player][roman type] &gt; &quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the left hand status line is &quot;[player]&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the right hand status line is &quot;STR: [strength of the player]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That last rule doesn't quite do what we might have expected. When we print &quot;[player]&quot;, we find that Inform usually prints &quot;yourself&quot;. This is because Inform says &quot;you&quot; to mean Teresa when talking to the player-being-Teresa, and likewise for Maleska. We want to override that in this particular story, because the rapid switches of personality are otherwise hard to follow. So:</p>
