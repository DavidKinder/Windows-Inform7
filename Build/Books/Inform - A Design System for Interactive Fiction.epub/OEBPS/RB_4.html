</table><p class="sectionheading"><a id="s1"></a>§4.1. The Passage Of Time</p>
<p>A story that makes heavy use of time may want to give the player a hint that time is important - and an easy way to keep track of how it's going - by adding the current time to the status line, instead of the score. To do this, we would write</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10644" -->
<a id="c10644"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins: change the right hand status line to &quot;[time of day]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>All else being equal, time passes at a rate of one minute per turn. But this need not be so: we can imagine a story where turns take much less time, or much more; or a story in which the passage of time was sometimes suspended, or one in which different actions required different amounts of time to perform.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Situation Room</span> provides a way to print 24-hour time, while <span class="boldface">Zqlran Era 8</span> implements a completely new measurement of time, for a story set on an alien world.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Uptempo</span> and <span class="boldface">The Hang of Thursdays</span> speed up time's passage: turns take fifteen minutes in the former, or a quarter day in the latter.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Timeless</span> makes certain actions instant, so that they don't count against the clock; this is sometimes useful in timed situations where the player needs to review the situation before going on with a tricky puzzle. <span class="boldface">Endurance</span> systematically extends this idea to allow us to assign different durations to any action in the story. <span class="boldface">The Big Sainsbury's</span> goes the opposite direction, and meticulously adds a minute to the clock for all implicit take actions, just so that the player isn't allowed to economize on moves.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to time is not to tell the player specifically what hour of the day it is at all, but to move from one general time period to another as it becomes appropriate - when the player has solved enough puzzles, or worked his way through enough of the plot. To this end we might use scenes representing, say, Thursday afternoon and then Thursday evening; then our scene rules, rather than the clock, would determine when Thursday afternoon stopped and Thursday evening began:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10645" -->
<a id="c10645"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Thursday afternoon is a scene. Thursday evening is a scene.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c10646" -->
<a id="c10646"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Thursday afternoon ends when the player carries the portfolio.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c10647" -->
<a id="c10647"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Thursday evening begins when Thursday afternoon ends.
<br />When Thursday evening begins:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;The great clock over St. Margaret's begins to chime 6.&quot;;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Though this gives time a loose relation to the number of turns played, it feels surprisingly realistic: players tend to think of time in a story in terms of the number of <span class="italic">significant</span> moves they made, while the random wandering, taking inventory, and looking at room descriptions while stuck don't make as big an impression. So advancing the story clock alongside the player's puzzle solutions or plot progress can work just as well as any stricter calculation.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s2"></a>§4.2. Scripted Scenes</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to arrange a scene in which something goes on in the background (as though it were a movie playing) while the player goes about his business; or where a series of things has to happen before the player gets to the end.</p>
<p>The simplest way to arrange background events for a scene is to write the sequence of events into a table and work our way through it, printing one line per turn, until the scene runs out. <span class="boldface">Day One</span> does exactly this.</p>
<p>At other times, we want a scene to last as long as it takes the <span class="italic">player</span> to do something. <span class="boldface">Entrapment</span> lets the player poke around and explore as much as he likes, but ends as soon as he has accomplished the scene's goal - which, unfortunately for him, is to get into an embarrassing situation so that another character can walk in and make fun of him. <span class="boldface">The Prague Job</span> has a scene that requires the player to do a more specific set of tasks, but nags him and hurries him along until he's done.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Bowler Hats and Baby Geese</span> assumes that our story is going to be assembled with a number of scenes, some of which will need to prevent the player from leaving the location until the scene is complete: it thus defines a &quot;restricted&quot; property for scenes, so that all such elements of the plot will work in the same way.</p>
<p>For more complex sorts of scripts and schedules, it may be worth consulting the extensions.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s3"></a>§4.3. Event Scheduling</p>
<p>We can use a schedule of events to give some life to our environment: if we have a town setting, for instance, it makes sense for shops and libraries to open and close at set times; this is just what we find in <span class="boldface">IPA</span>.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Air Conditioning Is Standard</span> has characters who follow a timed schedule of events to interact with each other, while the player mostly wanders around missing out on the action. (Sometimes life is like that.) The same effects could have been achieved with scenes instead of clock times, but there are occasions when we do want to plan our characters' behavior to the minute rather than waiting for the player to be in the right place to observe it: in a murder mystery or a time-travel story, the exact timings might be quite significant.</p>
<p>We may also want to add events to the schedule during play, as in</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10648" -->
<a id="c10648"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
 Instead of pushing the egg-timer: say &quot;It begins to mark time.&quot;; the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.

<p>The viewpoint character may often need to remember events long past. The easiest way to do this is with a cut-scene, in which at some relevant point we pause the story and print a long passage of text describing the memory. Because large amounts of text can be hard for the player to take in, we may want to include some pauses in the presentation of this material; this facility is provided by the Basic Screen Effects extension by Emily Short, and might work something like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10650" -->
<a id="c10650"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c10651" -->
<a id="c10651"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of examining the photograph for the first time:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;This reminds you of the summer of '69...&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;wait for any key;

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;pause the game&quot; phrase in the same extension offers a more dramatic pause that also clears the screen before printing new text.</p>
<p>Cut-scenes are easy to implement but should be used sparingly, since players often get impatient with long uninteractive passages. A slightly more deluxe implementation might insert an interactive scene that simply happens to be set in the past, before going on with another scene set &quot;now&quot;; and, indeed, some IF abandons the idea of &quot;now&quot; entirely, presenting pieces in a non-chronological order and letting the player work out how the sequence works together.</p>
<p>The most challenging case to implement (though still not very hard) is the one where we remove the player from one scenario, let him play through a flashback with past possessions and clothing, and then restore him to the same situation he left, with all of the same possessions and clothing. <span class="boldface">Pine 3</span> shows how to do this: the code to change the player's status is isolated at the end of the example, and might fruitfully be reused.  <span class="boldface">Pine 4</span> expands on the same idea by adding another flashback scene, demonstrating one that can be visited repeatedly and one that can be seen only once.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s6"></a>§4.6. Plot Management</p>
<p>A plot manager (sometimes called a drama manager) is a piece of the program whose job it is to plan out events so that, whatever the player does, the story advances and an interesting narrative results. The plot manager might, for instance, decide that the player has wandered around for too many scenes without making any progress, and might compensate by making something happen that gives him a new hint on his current problem. It might trigger characters to act when it thinks the story should be reaching a crisis point. It might introduce new complications when it determines that the player is running out of problems to solve.</p>
<p>This is a theoretically challenging field. Sophisticated plot management requires that the story make difficult guesses, such as whether the player is &quot;stuck&quot; and what the player is working on right now. The advantage of using such a system is that (done very well) it makes the story extremely responsive to the player's behavior, which means that he is a real agent in the unwinding of the plot. It also contributes to the replayability, since trying the story a second or third time will produce quite different outcomes. But it is procedurally difficult to design a good plot management system and it requires a huge amount of content, as well: in order for the plot manager to give the player hints, change the course of events to suit his focus, and so on, the story has to have available many, many more scenes than will ever occur in any single playing.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Fate Steps In</span> is only a <span class="italic">very</span> brief sketch in this direction, one in which the &quot;fate&quot; entity is trying to accomplish an end goal and, every turn, looks for ways to push the story towards that conclusion, whatever the player does.</p>

<p>Implicit takes are a convenience to players; in general, we would like to avoid asking players to type any more obvious commands than strictly necessary, while allowing the computer to guess as much as it safely can.</p>
<p>Occasionally, though, we have designed a timed puzzle in which the player has a limited number of moves in which to accomplish his objectives. In that case, the implicit take complicates matters, because it means that a player who types</p>

<p>Here we move to a systematic way of giving different durations to different actions, including even variations on the same act -- so that for instance climbing a steep hill might take several minutes more than other going actions. We do this by setting a number, &quot;work duration&quot;, to represent the number of minutes consumed by a given action, and then consulting a rulebook to find out how long the past turn's action should take. By default, an action will take 1 minute.</p>
<p>We'll start by emulating the behavior of &quot;Uptempo&quot;: each turn we'll set the clock forward most of the way, then check to see what has changed since the last turn, print any relevant events, and only then set the clock forward the final minute. The exception is when an action is set to take no time at all; in that case, we'll skip the rest of the turn sequence rules entirely.</p>

<p>The power of scenes lies in their ability to watch for general conditions and move the narrative along whenever these are fulfilled. Instead of waiting for the player to do one specific thing, the game waits for the world to be in a certain condition, before moving to the next stage of the plot.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we have a story in which the player has been captured for doing something inappropriate at court and is brought in to await a meeting with a palace official. We want to give the player a few minutes to stew, and we want the scene to end with him doing something mildly peculiar or embarrassing, and the official catching him in the act. So we tempt him into trying any of a number of different kooky activities, and just wait until he falls into the trap...</p>

<p>Scenes can have properties -- a fact that is very useful when it comes to writing a series of scenes that all need to act alike in some respect.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a plot that features a number of scripted scenes, where we need the player to stand still and wait while the events of the scene play out. One way to set this up is to create a property for such scenes -- let's call them &quot;restricted&quot; -- and then write a rule that keeps the player in place while the scene happens:</p>

This is the greatest fallacy of your computer-semi-literate generation, that you can get anything out of Google if you need it. Not only is this demonstrably false, but it overlooks something phenomenally important: you only know to look for something if you already know it EXISTS. In short there is no way to fake knowledge, and I am not going to pretend there is.' He smiles in lupine fashion.

<p>For some games, it makes sense to organize the entire game around scenes rather than around locations, moving the player when a new scene begins and laying out new props.</p>
<p>To this end, we might extend Inform's default handling of scenes so that each scene has properties to indicate prop lists and locations, and move objects in and out of play automatically as the scenes change. For instance:</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The starting location is the room to which the player should be moved; scenery props are things that need to be put there when the scene begins; inventory props, things that are given to the player when the scene begins; and the description some printed text to introduce the new scene. We may still occasionally need to have recourse to special &quot;When the Dancing-Lesson begins...&quot; rules for individual scenes, but for the most part this allows us to set scenes up in a consistent and predictable way.</p>
<p>Another point that might be slightly less obvious: sometimes we want to announce a change of location to the player when the scene starts, and sometimes we don't. In particular any scene that starts &quot;when play begins&quot; should probably not explicitly describe the entered room, since that would duplicate the description automatically produced on the first turn of play. So we add a property to track whether any given scene should be announcing its location:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10928_123" -->
<a id="c10928_123"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A scene can be location-silent or location-loud.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And let's say that we also want to announce each new scene as another &quot;chapter&quot; of the game in play, with a pause before the scene begins.</p>
<p>Here we include &quot;Basic Screen Effects&quot; because it will allow us to pause the game for a keypress, then clear the screen before each new chapter:</p>

<p>One of the nice things about before rules for actions is that they allow us to express some planning for characters other than the player: we've already seen how this works, a bit. But we could also use before rules to write plans for an abstract story-driving entity, rather than for other individual characters. This story-driver could be in charge of all the non-player characters, as well as spontaneous or natural changes in the environment, shaping the narrative around the player's behavior.</p>
