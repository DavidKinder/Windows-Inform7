<p>As we have seen, Inform divides up space into individual places called &quot;rooms&quot;, and allows us to group rooms together into &quot;regions&quot; if we find that convenient. And Inform also divides time up, into individual turns. These too we can group together: the equivalent of a region is a &quot;scene&quot;.</p>
<p>To put this another way, if we think of the interactive fiction as a stage play, then up to now it has simply contained endless dialogue and stage directions - there has been no convenient way to divide up its running time into dramatic episodes, in the same way that a playwright might make Act II take place in the same drawing-room as Act I, but (let us say) six months later, after many things have changed. The script contains cues for one scene to end and another to begin: when those cues are reached, the stage hands rearrange props, actors reposition themselves and so on.</p>
<p>Inform also allows us to create scenes, with cues for them to start and end, and some stage machinery (so to speak) making it easy to move the action on. But interactive fiction is <span class="italic">interactive</span>, so the metaphor of the theatre only goes so far. We can have several different scenes going on at once - perhaps with the relevant events taking place in different rooms, which the player is free to walk between. And the player may make a choice which changes the story-line, causing scenes to happen which otherwise would not have happened, and so on. Scenes can even be &quot;recurring&quot;, that is, can repeat themselves.</p>
<p>So organising the story-line into scenes is not simply a matter of making a list (Scene 1, then Scene 2, then Scene 3, <span class="italic">finis</span>). It is more like a chart in which one scene can lead in several possible ways to others - a sort of map of time, which as we shall see Inform displays in its &quot;Scenes&quot; index.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s2"></a>§10.2. Creating a scene</p>
<p>As usual, we only need to say that something is a scene to make it so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2368" -->
<a id="c2368"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Train Stop is a scene.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We conventionally write scene names with capital letters, as this demonstrates.</p>
<p>This works, and shows up in the &quot;Scenes&quot; index, but does nothing. We have given no instructions on when it begins - no cue, in stage-play terms - so it never will begin, and even if it did, nobody would notice since it does nothing. First, to give it a beginning:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2369" -->
<a id="c2369"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Train Stop begins when the player is in the Station for the third turn.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In theory any condition can be used to cue the scene - here, it's &quot;the player is in the Station for the third turn&quot; - but it's wise to look for a state of affairs which will last at least a brief time, because scene changes only happen at the start and end of turns. (Something like &quot;...when examining the timetable&quot; may be true only for a part of the middle of a turn, and so go unnoticed.)</p>
<p>Every scene has two rulebooks attached, one at each end, so to speak. These look very like &quot;when play begins&quot; and &quot;when play ends&quot;, and work in the same way. Thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2370" -->
<a id="c2370"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When Train Stop begins:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the Flying Scotsman is in the Station;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;The Flying Scotsman pulls up at the platform, to a billow of steam and hammering.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2371" -->
<a id="c2371"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When Train Stop ends:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the Flying Scotsman is nowhere;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player is in the Station, say &quot;The Flying Scotsman inches away, with a squeal of released brakes, gathering speed invincibly until it disappears around the hill. All is abruptly still once more.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Thus when the scene begins, our imaginary stage-hands wheel in a steam train; when it ends, they get rid of it again. Note that we know where the player will be at the start of the scene, but by the end he may have wandered off across the fields, so we must be careful not to report something he might not be in a position to see.</p>
<p>When Train Stop begins, we printed some text, but we did this by hand. We didn't need to, because Inform automatically prints out the description of a scene (if it has one) when the scene begins. Scenes can have properties, just like objects, and in particular they have the &quot;description&quot; property. For example, we could write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2372" -->
<a id="c2372"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Arrival is a scene. &quot;There's a flourish of trumpets.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which saves us the trouble of writing the rule:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2373" -->
<a id="c2373"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When Arrival begins: say &quot;There's a flourish of trumpets.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can also write rules like this which apply to a whole variety of scenes at once. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2374" -->
<a id="c2374"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A scene can be bright or dim. A scene is usually dim. Dawn is a bright scene.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2375" -->
<a id="c2375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When a scene which is bright ends: say &quot;So passes the bright [scene being changed].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here, instead of naming a scene (&quot;Train Stop&quot;), we've given a description (&quot;a scene which is bright&quot;). When a scene begins, these general rules come before those which name the scene exactly; when it ends, the reverse is true.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s3"></a>§10.3. Using the Scene index</p>
<p>But when we test the previous section's example, we find that after a brief wait, the train pulls up: but it never goes away again. We have given instructions on how the scene ends, but not when it ends, and as a result the scene goes on forever once started.</p>
<p>Even with simple story-lines, and this one could hardly be simpler, it is surprisingly easy to overlook something so that the whole story-line is derailed.</p>
<p>The Scenes page of the index is intended to help with this. The Plot section shows all of the scenes and how they are to begin, along with a key to the symbols used on it. One scene always included is &quot;Entire Game&quot;, a special scene which, as its name implies, is always being played out. But if we look at the Scene index for the previous example, we will also see our Train Stop scene, and find that it is marked with the red warning symbol for &quot;never ends&quot;. Let us fix this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2376" -->
<a id="c2376"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Train Stop ends when the time since Train Stop began is 3 minutes.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note the useful value &quot;time since Train Stop began&quot;:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn111" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn111"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>time since </b>(scene)<b> began ... time</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_scenetimesincebegan -->

<p>This phrase produces the time since the named scene began, which only makes sense, of course, if it has indeed begun. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2377" -->
<a id="c2377"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
time since Entire Game began
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn112" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn112"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>time since </b>(scene)<b> ended ... time</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_scenetimesinceended -->

<p>This phrase produces the time since the named scene ended, which only makes sense, of course, if it has indeed ended. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2378" -->
<a id="c2378"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
time since Formal Dinner ended
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>The actual times, in case they are needed, can be obtained with:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn113" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn113"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>time when </b>(scene)<b> began ... time</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_scenetimewhenbegan -->

<p>This phrase produces the time (i.e., the value of the &quot;time of day&quot; variable) at the moment when the given scene began.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn114" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn114"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>time when </b>(scene)<b> ended ... time</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_scenetimewhenended -->

<p>This phrase produces the time (i.e., the value of the &quot;time of day&quot; variable) at the moment when the given scene ended.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>The testing command SCENES causes Inform to monitor the beginning and ending of scenes, and report on them. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2379" -->
<a id="c2379"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;ask monk about lodging
<br />&quot;Welcome a poor traveler for the night?&quot; you ask, rubbing your fingers together to restore a little feeling.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2380" -->
<a id="c2380"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The monk looks you up and down for a moment and you sense his reaction hanging in the balance; then he slaps you on the back, hard enough to drive the air from your lungs. &quot;In.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2381" -->
<a id="c2381"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
[Scene 'Greeting' ends]
<br />The monk takes your elbow and pushes you imperiously toward dinner.
<br />[Scene 'Banquet' begins]

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s4"></a>§10.4. During scenes</p>
<p>Scenes are not only useful for changing the setting, by moving items or people around and providing a little narration. We can also make the rules different in one scene from another. For instance, at a sleepy country halt there is no reason why one should not walk across the tracks: but if there is a train in the way, that would be impossible.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2382" -->
<a id="c2382"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before going north during the Train Stop, say &quot;The train blocks your way.&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Any rule can have the clause &quot;during ...&quot; attached, provided that clause goes at the end and either explicitly names a scene, or gives a description of which scenes would match. This is especially useful with &quot;every turn&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2383" -->
<a id="c2383"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn during the Train Stop, say &quot;Water is sluiced out of the tank and into the engine.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can test whether a scene is happening with the adjective &quot;happening&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2384" -->
<a id="c2384"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if Train Stop is happening, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START PHRASE "defn115" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn115"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has happened:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hashappened -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene has both begun and ended.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn116" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn116"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has not happened:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hasnothappened -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene has not ended (or never started).</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn117" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn117"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has ended:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hasended -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene ended at least once.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn118" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn118"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has not ended:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hasnotended -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene has never ended.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>We need to be a bit careful: it's possible to set things up so that the Train Stop scene will play out more than once, so &quot;Train Stop is happening&quot; and &quot;Train Stop has happened&quot; might both be true at once.</p>
<p>The kind of value &quot;scene&quot; is one which is allowed to have properties - it has a tick in the &quot;properties&quot; column in the chart in the Kinds index - and this can be very useful in describing scenes. For instance, we could write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2385" -->
<a id="c2385"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A scene can be thrilling or dull. Train Stop is dull.
<br />A scene has a text called cue speech. The cue speech of Train Stop is &quot;All aboard!&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform has the adjectives &quot;recurring&quot;, &quot;non-recurring&quot; and &quot;happening&quot; all built in to describe scenes, and the above would add &quot;thrilling&quot; and &quot;dull&quot;. Moreover, the &quot;during&quot; clause of a rule can give a description of a scene as easily as a specific scene name. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2386" -->
<a id="c2386"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before going north during a dull non-recurring scene, ...
</p></blockquote>

<p>We are allowed to link the beginning or end of any scene to the beginning or end of any other scene. So, for instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2389" -->
<a id="c2389"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Luggage Trouble is a scene. Luggage Trouble begins when Brief Encounter begins.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Thus the two scenes run concurrently, at least for a while. We can also add that:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2390" -->
<a id="c2390"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Luggage Trouble ends when Brief Encounter ends.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This can be useful when a large, complicated scene really contains several smaller sub-scenes.</p>
<p>A special exceptional case is that we can have any scene or scenes starting right at the outset:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2391" -->
<a id="c2391"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Railway Meeting is a scene. Railway Meeting begins when play begins.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>When play ends, of course, all scenes end, so there is no need to say that.</p>

<p>It is quite allowed for a scene to be linked to several other scenes, and this is useful if several alternate strands of plot are being brought together in a common resolution scene:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2392" -->
<a id="c2392"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Bittersweet Ending begins when Stranger's Rejection ends.
<br />Bittersweet Ending begins when Stranger's Acceptance ends.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and we can also have the same scene beginning when a condition holds. In general, it will begin the first time it gets any chance to do so.</p>
<p>All scenes are ordinarily set up so that they can happen only once. But sometimes we want them to repeat. Suppose the train calls not once only, but every twenty minutes. We could set this up with two scenes linked back to back like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2393" -->
<a id="c2393"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Train Stop is a recurring scene. Train Wait is a recurring scene.
<br />Train Wait begins when play begins.
<br />Train Stop begins when Train Wait ends.
<br />Train Wait begins when Train Stop ends.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The difference here is that these scenes have been declared as &quot;recurring&quot;. In all other respects they are the same as any other scene.</p>

<p>Interactive fictions vary considerably in the extent to which the player is allowed to influence the story-line. Sometimes the appearance of making choices is wholly bogus, as only one possible line is given more than lip service. But in other works, the player can radically change the outcome, and whole rafts of plot differ between one person's experience and another's. Inform allows multiple endings to its scenes to make this kind of branching story-line easy to achieve.</p>
<p>Any scene can have up to 31 alternate endings, differentiated by name (unless the Z-machine format has been selected on the Settings panel, in which case, 15). These alternates are created as and when conditions are set for them:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2394" -->
<a id="c2394"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Brief Encounter ends happily when ...
<br />Brief Encounter ends wisely but sadly when ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;Ends happily&quot; and &quot;ends wisely but sadly&quot; behave just like &quot;ends&quot;. We can have rules &quot;When Brief Encounter ends happily, ...&quot; and so forth, in addition to rules &quot;When Brief Encounter ends, ...&quot; - if a rule doesn't specify any particular ending, it applies to all of them.</p>
<p>We can also link rules together from these branches, so</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2395" -->
<a id="c2395"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Stranger's Acceptance begins when Brief Encounter ends happily.
<br />Stranger's Rejection begins when Brief Encounter ends wisely but sadly.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>With this set-up and that of the previous section, there are now two possible paths through the story:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2396" -->
<a id="c2396"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
(i) Train Stop - Brief Encounter - Stranger's Acceptance - Bittersweet Ending
<br />(ii) Train Stop - Brief Encounter - Stranger's Rejection - Bittersweet Ending
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We might later need to know which of these paths has been taken, and to help with this Inform provides conditions like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2397" -->
<a id="c2397"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if Brief Encounter ended happily ...
<br />if Brief Encounter did not end happily ...
<br />if Brief Encounter ended wisely but sadly ...
<br />if Brief Encounter did not end wisely but sadly ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(For a scene which repeats, note that these conditions apply only to the most recent repetition: and that such conditions are always false if the scene is currently going on. &quot;Brief Encounter did not end happily&quot; will be true only when the scene has finished but in a different way.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s9"></a>§10.9. Why are scenes designed this way?</p>
<p>In the part it plays in stories, time is like space. The endings of a scene (along with its beginning) are like the map connections leading out of a room. The Scenes index keeps track of the &quot;map of time&quot; through which these possible story-lines traverse. Some works of IF will have immensely complicated story-lines in only a few rooms, some will have no scenes at all despite a sprawling geography. The Scenes and World index tabs, side by side, show both kinds of map.</p>
<p>Just as Inform uses a simple but practical design for the boundaries between rooms (map connections and doors, that is), it also simplifies transitions between scenes. Scenes are based on states of things: we give circumstances for them to begin or end. There is no phrase with the power to say &quot;make Act II begin right now&quot;, so perhaps it is worth explaining why not. The state-based approach was chosen because:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2398" -->
<a id="c2398"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
* it guarantees that each action falls entirely inside, or entirely outside, of any given scene (and therefore that &quot;during...&quot; clauses in the conditions for a rule are not affected by rule ordering);
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2399" -->
<a id="c2399"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
* it ensures that scene changes occur outside actions, like every turn rules;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2400" -->
<a id="c2400"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
* it promotes a style of writing which makes it clearer to the reader of the source text when a scene begins and ends, and what conditions are guaranteed to be true during it;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2401" -->
<a id="c2401"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
* it makes it possible for the Scenes index page to show this information in a communicative way.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Settings in IF where one revisits the same location but at a different time, or after a dramatic change, have historically been difficult to test properly and prone to mistakes. (The classic example would be where a character killed during Act I reappears unharmed in Act II.) The design of scenes is an attempt to encourage a style of writing which minimises the risk of these accidents.</p>
<p>Since scenes are, in the end, only a convenient way to organise rules, and do nothing that cannot be done by other means, this simplified system of scene changing does not really restrict us.</p>

<p>The power of scenes lies in their ability to watch for general conditions and move the narrative along whenever these are fulfilled. Instead of waiting for the player to do one specific thing, the game waits for the world to be in a certain condition, before moving to the next stage of the plot.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we have a story in which the player has been captured for doing something inappropriate at court and is brought in to await a meeting with a palace official. We want to give the player a few minutes to stew, and we want the scene to end with him doing something mildly peculiar or embarrassing, and the official catching him in the act. So we tempt him into trying any of a number of different kooky activities, and just wait until he falls into the trap...</p>

<p>Scenes can have properties -- a fact that is very useful when it comes to writing a series of scenes that all need to act alike in some respect.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a plot that features a number of scripted scenes, where we need the player to stand still and wait while the events of the scene play out. One way to set this up is to create a property for such scenes -- let's call them &quot;restricted&quot; -- and then write a rule that keeps the player in place while the scene happens:</p>

<p>And now let's set up our restricted scene. In it, a clown is going to turn up wherever the player is (it doesn't matter where on the map he's gotten to at this point) and do a performance; the player will not be able to leave the area until the performance completes.

<p>So much, we had before. Now, suppose we want a conversation style which allows the player to move conversation forward by asking appropriate questions, but which will keep moving forward even if he doesn't. To this end, we provide a table -- a borrowing from a later chapter. In the table, we record two ways of performing each conversation bit, one which reflects the player's participation, and one in which the character moves things onward:</p>

<p>For some games, it makes sense to organize the entire game around scenes rather than around locations, moving the player when a new scene begins and laying out new props.</p>
<p>To this end, we might extend Inform's default handling of scenes so that each scene has properties to indicate prop lists and locations, and move objects in and out of play automatically as the scenes change. For instance:</p>

<p>The starting location is the room to which the player should be moved; scenery props are things that need to be put there when the scene begins; inventory props, things that are given to the player when the scene begins; and the description some printed text to introduce the new scene. We may still occasionally need to have recourse to special &quot;When the Dancing-Lesson begins...&quot; rules for individual scenes, but for the most part this allows us to set scenes up in a consistent and predictable way.</p>
<p>Another point that might be slightly less obvious: sometimes we want to announce a change of location to the player when the scene starts, and sometimes we don't. In particular any scene that starts &quot;when play begins&quot; should probably not explicitly describe the entered room, since that would duplicate the description automatically produced on the first turn of play. So we add a property to track whether any given scene should be announcing its location:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2573_123" -->
<a id="c2573_123"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A scene can be location-silent or location-loud.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And let's say that we also want to announce each new scene as another &quot;chapter&quot; of the game in play, with a pause before the scene begins.</p>
<p>Here we include &quot;Basic Screen Effects&quot; because it will allow us to pause the game for a keypress, then clear the screen before each new chapter:</p>

<p>As we have seen, there are a number of different ways of controlling conversation in interactive fiction, and the best choice of way will depend quite a lot on what kind of work we're writing.</p>
<p>One common model is to replace Inform's default ASK and TELL commands with a TALK TO command. This gives the player less control than he would otherwise have: instead of asking a character about any topic under the sun, he's restricted to seeing (or not seeing) a single sequence of text that the author has written in advance. On the other hand, such a system is harder for the player to break (since he can never ask about a topic that the author hasn't implemented), and easier for the author to tie into plot developments. If we give TALK TO different output at each scene, we get conversation that is always tied to the current state of the plot.</p>
<p>This is a design approach that works best in a game with a large number of short, focused scenes. For other kinds of conversation system design, compare the other examples listed in the Recipe Book.</p>

<br />&quot;With a fart and a roar, Heracles asks the world at large, and you in particular, where his dinner might be.&quot;
<br />&quot;In epic diction, Heracles invites the dairy-mistresses, whey-matrons, and concubines of curd to supply him a supper from their ample baskets.&quot;
<br />&quot;Heracles and the chorus banter about the proclivities of cheese-wives. The chorus suggest that Heracles, as a son of Zeus, must know something about the appetites of which they speak.&quot;
<br />&quot;Heracles boasts that a man like himself can perform any feat, but only when his belly is full. Coyly, the matrons prance and dance, skip and gambol out of his grasp, singing mockingly about heads of garlic and loaves of sesame-crusted bread.&quot;
<br />&quot;The song of the feta fanciers now turns to pots of honey and new-made wine, borrowing verses from last year's Lenaia winner, 'The Bees'. With a jolt, you realize that you've missed your cue and the chorus are filling in for you.&quot;
<br />&quot;Playing for time, the chorus-leader elaborates a whole banquet: rabbit stew, shanks of lamb, spitted quails, eels from lake Copais. Heracles looks as near swooning as any girl fresh from Brauron.&quot;
<br />&quot;The chorus-leader extends the list of delicacies to include ox-brains, ham-hocks, barley, mullet, carrots, pigeons, lentils, radishes, peas, and apples both wine-dark and golden. The audience shifts on the benches. An expression of gloom settles over the Priest of Dionysus in the front row.&quot;
<br />&quot;Inspired by Euripides['] own Muse, the chorus-leader invents a mock-Alcaean hymn on the merits of chervil. This is clearly his swan-song: if you don't speak at last, the play will come to a halt.&quot;
<br />&quot;Silence descends.&quot;
