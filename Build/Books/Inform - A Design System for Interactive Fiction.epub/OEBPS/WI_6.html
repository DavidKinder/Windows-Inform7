</table><p class="sectionheading"><a id="s1"></a>§6.1. What are descriptions?</p>
<p>It is in describing circumstances that Inform really capitalises on the concise, expressive power of natural language, and this chapter brings together the facts about &quot;descriptions&quot;.</p>
<p>The simplest descriptions consist of a noun alone. Some refer to single things (&quot;lantern&quot;, or &quot;wine cask&quot;), others to kinds of thing (&quot;dead end&quot; or &quot;container&quot;). But we have also seen adjectives alone:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1044" -->
<a id="c1044"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The oaken desk is <span class="boldface">fixed in place</span>.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here, &quot;fixed in place&quot; is a description which, to Inform's simple-minded grammar, is a single adjective. And of course adjectives and nouns can be combined:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1045" -->
<a id="c1045"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The cargo trunk is an <span class="boldface">openable container</span>.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The description &quot;openable container&quot; consists of the noun &quot;container&quot;, meaning a kind of thing, and the adjective &quot;openable&quot;, which means one of the two possible states of an either/or property held by that thing.</p>
<p>As the next chapter will show, rules also make great use of descriptions:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1046" -->
<a id="c1046"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of throwing <span class="boldface">something</span> at a <span class="boldface">closed openable door</span>, say &quot;Or you could just use the handle like anyone else, of course.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We have already seen that we can list the items fitting a given description:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1047" -->
<a id="c1047"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;You look down at [the list of <span class="boldface">things in the basket</span>].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It's also sometimes convenient to count them up:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn59" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn59"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>number of </b>(description of values)<b> ... number</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_numberof -->

<p>This phrase counts the number of values matching the description, which may of course be 0. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1048" -->
<a id="c1048"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
number of open doors
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>produces the number of doors, anywhere in the model world, which are currently open. A Problem message is produced if the number is potentially infinite, or impractical to count: for instance, Inform rejects &quot;number of odd numbers&quot;.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>It is because descriptions are so widely useful that they deserve a chapter of their own, and this is it.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s2"></a>§6.2. Adjectives and nouns</p>
<p>Descriptions can contain a noun, but need not, and can contain any number of adjectives:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1049" -->
<a id="c1049"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
supporter = <span class="italic">the noun</span> supporter
<br />closed = <span class="italic">the adjective</span> closed
<br />the open wine cask = <span class="italic">the adjective</span> open + <span class="italic">the noun</span> wine cask
<br />something portable = (some) + <span class="italic">the noun</span> thing + <span class="italic">the adjective</span> portable
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that we are not allowed to have more than one noun in the same description (something English occasionally does allow as a coded form of emphasis, as in &quot;the man Jenkins&quot; or &quot;the harlot Helen&quot;).</p>
<p>Nouns are simple enough, referring either to kinds or specific things. The noun &quot;something&quot; means &quot;some thing&quot;, so is actually a reference to the kind &quot;thing&quot;. Inform treats this as having the same meaning as &quot;anything&quot;, and all told there are eight special nouns of this kind, but with only three different meanings between them:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1050" -->
<a id="c1050"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
something = anything
<br />someone = anyone = somebody = anybody
<br />somewhere = anywhere
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>So for instance &quot;anybody male&quot; or &quot;somewhere dark&quot; are valid descriptions. These eight nouns are unusual in being allowed to come at the front of a description: nouns are usually expected to be at the end. (Inform also understands &quot;nothing&quot;, &quot;nowhere&quot;, &quot;nobody&quot;, &quot;no-one&quot; and even &quot;no one&quot;, which in a sense are opposites of &quot;something&quot; and the like, but for now we'll look at descriptions of things which do exist rather than don't.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s3"></a>§6.3. Sources of adjectives</p>
<p>We have seen two sorts of adjectives so far: those which refer to either/or properties, like &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot;, and those which come out of new kinds of value. If we define</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1051" -->
<a id="c1051"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Texture is a kind of value. The textures are rough, stubbly and smooth. Everything has a texture.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...then &quot;rough&quot;, &quot;stubbly&quot; and &quot;smooth&quot; all become adjectives. (That last sentence &quot;Everything has a texture&quot; was essential, because without it Inform would not know that these words could meaningfully be applied to things.)</p>
<p>In addition to these adjectives, we can create new ones (as we shall see), and a few special adjectives such as &quot;visible&quot;, &quot;touchable&quot; and &quot;adjacent&quot; are already defined for us by Inform.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s4"></a>§6.4. Defining new adjectives</p>
<p>Suppose we want to coin a word for supporters currently supporting something. We can do so with the following sentence:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1052" -->
<a id="c1052"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: A supporter is occupied if something is on it.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note the colon, which is essential, and the usage of &quot;it&quot; in the definition part to refer to the object in question. (For this purpose we would write &quot;it&quot; even if we were defining a term about, say, a woman instead of a supporter, so that &quot;she&quot; or &quot;her&quot; might seem more appropriate - but see below.)</p>
<p>This creates the adjective &quot;occupied&quot;, and gives it a definition valid for supporters. That restriction on validity means that non-supporters would always fail the description &quot;something occupied&quot;; which might be unfortunate if we wanted to talk about rooms being occupied. We could give a second definition thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1053" -->
<a id="c1053"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: A room is occupied if a person is in it.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These are entirely different senses of the word &quot;occupied&quot; - a mantelpiece is occupied if an invitation is on it, but for a drawing room to be occupied there must be human presence - and Inform applies whichever sense is relevant when deciding whether or not a given object is &quot;occupied&quot;.</p>
<p>Often, though not always, we also want to give a name to the opposite possibility. We can do that as follows:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1054" -->
<a id="c1054"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: A room is occupied rather than unoccupied if a person is in it.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;rather than...&quot; part of the definition is optional, but it saves having to write a boringly similar definition of &quot;unoccupied&quot; out in longhand. (Note that Inform does not guess the meaning of &quot;unoccupied&quot; unless it has been explicitly told it. Such guesses are too risky, when so many &quot;un-&quot; words fail to conform to this pattern: &quot;unified&quot;, &quot;uncle&quot;, &quot;ungulate&quot; and so on.)</p>
<p>Newly defined adjectives cannot be used when creating things, because they are not explicit enough. Inform could not satisfy:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1055" -->
<a id="c1055"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Ballroom is occupied. The bucket is a large container.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because there is not enough information: by whom is the Ballroom occupied? How large, exactly? On the other hand, newly defined adjectives are very helpful in conditions and for rules, as we shall see later on.</p>
<p>It is occasionally clumsy having to refer to the subject of a definition using &quot;it&quot;. We can avoid this and give the definition better legibility by supplying a name instead. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1056" -->
<a id="c1056"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: a direction (called thataway) is viable if the room thataway from the location is a room.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which is a good deal easier to read than</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1057" -->
<a id="c1057"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: a direction is viable if the room it from the location is a room.

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s5"></a>§6.5. Defining adjectives for values</p>
<p>In general, any noun can have adjectives applied to it, and this means that values can have adjectives just as objects can. We have already seen that they can (in some cases, at least) have either/or properties, and this gives them adjectives just as for objects. But we can also write out definitions which apply to values:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1058" -->
<a id="c1058"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: A number is round if the remainder after dividing it by 10 is 0.
<br />Definition: A time is late rather than early if it is at least 8 PM.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That makes the numbers 20 and 170 but not 37 meet the description &quot;a round number&quot;, and the times 8 PM and 11:23 PM but not 9 AM meet the description &quot;a late time&quot;. Because they come up fairly often, Inform contains several adjectives for numbers built in:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1059" -->
<a id="c1059"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
positive - one which is greater than zero (but not 0 itself)
<br />negative - one which is less than zero (but not 0 itself)
<br />even - a number like ..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...
<br />odd - a number like ..., -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Similarly, two useful adjectives are built in to talk about text:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1060" -->
<a id="c1060"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
empty - the text &quot;&quot;, with no characters in it, not even spaces
<br />non-empty - any text which does have at least one character in
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Adjectives can have multiple definitions and, as long as each applies to a different sort of noun, there will be no problem. We could write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1061" -->
<a id="c1061"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A thing can be round, square or funny-shaped.
<br />A container can be odd or ordinary.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And these definitions of &quot;round&quot; and &quot;odd&quot; will not interfere with the ones applying to numbers, because Inform can always look at the noun to see which definition is meant in any given case. For instance,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1062" -->
<a id="c1062"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the score is round, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>must mean &quot;round&quot; in the sense of numbers, because the score is a number. Inform itself makes good use of this; &quot;empty&quot; also has meanings applying to rulebooks, lists and activities, for instance, as will be seen later.</p>
<p>Although it's more usual to give a definition to apply to a whole kind, we can actually give a specific definition to apply to just a single object or named value. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1063" -->
<a id="c1063"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, green and blue.
<br />Definition: red is subtle if the player is female.
<br />Definition: a colour is subtle if it is blue.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The first definition of &quot;subtle&quot; takes precedence, of course, since it has the more specific domain - it applies only to red. The effect of this is that, if the player's female, the subtle colours are red and blue; if not, just blue.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s6"></a>§6.6. Whereabouts on a scale?</p>
<p>Adjectives are often used in English to give a sense of where something is on a sliding scale. We talk about &quot;a tall man&quot; and &quot;a short man&quot;, but without meaning that all men are either tall or short. If pushed, we might say that tall means about 6 feet and up, short means about 5 feet 6 and down, but we more often compare one person's height against another's.</p>
<p>Inform allows us to use adjectives in the same way. For example, every container has a number called its &quot;carrying capacity&quot;. We can define:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1064" -->
<a id="c1064"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: A container is huge if its carrying capacity is 20 or more.
<br />Definition: A container is large if its carrying capacity is 10 or more.
<br />Definition: A container is standard if its carrying capacity is 7.
<br />Definition: A container is small if its carrying capacity is 5 or less.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These definitions are similar to those in the previous section, but have a very specific (and strictly enforced) shape to them. The adjective must be a single word. We have to say &quot;its&quot; (i.e., of it), not the ungrammatical &quot;it's&quot;; we have to specify a property, and a literal value of it, and we must either give an exact value or else conclude with &quot;or more&quot; or &quot;or less&quot;. If we create something with one of these properties:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1065" -->
<a id="c1065"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The basket is a large container in the Shop. The thimble is a small container in the Shop. The matchbox is a standard container in the Shop.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then they will have the most moderate values they can have, that is, the basket will have carrying capacity 10 and the thimble 5 (and of course the matchbox 7). Both of the following tests will then fail:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1066" -->
<a id="c1066"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the basket is huge ...
<br />if the basket is a small container ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because the basket is neither huge nor small, but somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Sometimes the meaning of adjectives must depend on their context, as we see from the following example, where we assess heights in inches:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1067" -->
<a id="c1067"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A person has a number called height. Definition: A man is tall if his height is 72 or more. Definition: A woman is tall if her height is 68 or more.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform then judges whether someone is or is not &quot;tall&quot; using different standards for men and for women, and</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1068" -->
<a id="c1068"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Shop are a tall man and a tall woman.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>creates a man 72 inches tall and a woman 68 inches tall.</p>

<p>we not only say how to test if something is large (see if its capacity is at least 10) and how to create something large (give it a capacity of exactly 10), we also create a new form of comparison. Thus,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1070" -->
<a id="c1070"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />if the thimble is not larger than the basket ...

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are both true. If we also define &quot;huge&quot; and &quot;small&quot;, as in the previous section, we also get comparisons &quot;huger than&quot; and &quot;smaller than&quot;. Note that &quot;huger than&quot; has exactly the same meaning as &quot;larger than&quot;: we can use whichever wording seems more natural. (For bacilli, for instance, we would probably not say &quot;huger than&quot;, even though the meaning would be unambiguous.)</p>
<p>We can also compare two things to see if they share the same value of a property. For instance, to go back to the heights example, once we define &quot;tall&quot; and &quot;short&quot;, we get that exactly one of the following will be true:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1071" -->
<a id="c1071"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if Adam is taller than Eve ...
<br />if Adam is the same height as Eve ...
<br />if Adam is shorter than Eve ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Though it will not always seem natural wording, we can use the comparison &quot;the same P as&quot; for any property P which has a value. Do we think &quot;if the basket is the same carrying capacity as the thimble&quot; is good English? Maybe, maybe not. But we are always at liberty to spell things out in full:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1072" -->
<a id="c1072"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

And in general there might be several equally large largest containers, in which case we should not rely on getting any particular one of those rather than another.</p>
<p>Note that Inform constructs comparatives and superlatives by a pretty simplistic system. If we want to use these forms for an adjective expressing the relatively large size of a room, we had better go with &quot;roomy&quot; (roomier, roomiest) - not &quot;spacious&quot; (spaciouser, spaciousest).</p>

<p>A description can not only talk about things in terms of themselves, but also in terms of their relationships to the rest of the world. For instance,</p>

<br />an animal carried by a man

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and indeed those are also valid descriptions. The other sentence verbs can all be used here, too. So for instance:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Since these clauses can be attached to the end of any valid description, descriptions can grow longer still:</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s10"></a>§6.10. Existence and there</p>
<p>&quot;There&quot; is a curious word in English, which mostly refers to some place which is being talked about - but which can sometimes mean the whole world. In Ian Fleming's novel &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;, a chapter narrating a committee meeting of SMERSH officers in Istanbul ends with one of the Russians saying:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1080" -->
<a id="c1080"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
There is a man called Bond.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>What does this &quot;there&quot; mean? It really just means that Bond exists. In fact, he's watching the meeting through a concealed periscope, but the SMERSH general doesn't know that. All he is saying is that Bond is out there somewhere, and is not imaginary, or dead.</p>
<p>Inform also allows &quot;there is&quot; (or &quot;there are&quot;) to talk about what exists, or does not. This is especially useful if, for some reason, we don't want to give a name to something. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1081" -->
<a id="c1081"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
There is a door in the Summerhouse.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Another reason might be that we want to create something but not put it anywhere. If Inform reads the sentence:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1082" -->
<a id="c1082"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
There is a man called Bond.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then it creates a man, gives him the name Bond, but places him initially off-stage - not in any room, that is, but available to be brought into play later on, like an actor who is not needed until Act II.</p>
<p>&quot;There&quot; also provides a useful way to test what exists:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1083" -->
<a id="c1083"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if there is a woman in the Summerhouse, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Or even:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1084" -->
<a id="c1084"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if there is a woman, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which will be true if the model world contains even a single woman, on-stage or off. The alternative &quot;there are&quot; can also be used:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1085" -->
<a id="c1085"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if there are women in the Summerhouse, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>but note that this does not necessarily imply more than one woman is present, despite the plural. If we want that, we have to be more explicit:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1086" -->
<a id="c1086"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if there is more than one woman in the Summerhouse, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>or, of course, we needn't use &quot;there is&quot; at all:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1087" -->
<a id="c1087"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if more than one woman is in the Summerhouse, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And we can also test non-existence:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1088" -->
<a id="c1088"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if there is nobody in the Summerhouse, ...
<br />if there is nothing on the mantelpiece, ...

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s11"></a>§6.11. A word about in</p>
<p>What does &quot;in&quot; mean? It's worth just a brief diversion to cover this, because &quot;in&quot; has two subtly different meanings.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Meaning 1.</span> Usually, if X is &quot;in&quot; Y then this is because of containment. A croquet ball is &quot;in&quot; a croquet box, which is &quot;in&quot; the Summerhouse. This is the standard meaning, and is the one which happens if we write something like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1089" -->
<a id="c1089"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The croquet ball is in the box.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>or if we ask a question like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1090" -->
<a id="c1090"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet box is in the Summerhouse, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This kind of &quot;in&quot; talks only about direct containment. If we ask</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1091" -->
<a id="c1091"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet ball is in the Summerhouse, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then the answer is that it isn't - it is in the box which is itself in the Summerhouse, but that's not the same thing.</p>
<p>This is almost always the meaning of &quot;in&quot; that we intend. This is only one of a number of relationships between objects - there are also &quot;part of&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;worn by&quot; and &quot;carried by&quot;, for example. If we have</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1092" -->
<a id="c1092"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The bird feed is on the sundial.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...then &quot;if the bird feed is in the sundial&quot; won't be true: the relationship here is one called support (being on top of, in effect), not containment. But there's no confusion because &quot;on&quot; and &quot;in&quot; are different words, so it's no problem that they have different meanings.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Meaning 2.</span> Much less common. If X is &quot;in&quot; Y and Y is a region, then the meaning is slightly different. Suppose the Garden Area is a region, and contains several rooms - the Croquet Lawn, the Terrace and so on. Then</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1093" -->
<a id="c1093"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet box is in the Garden Area, ...
<br />if the bird feed is in the Garden Area, ...
<br />if the Terrace is in the Garden Area, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are all true. This seems very natural, but in fact is quite different from the first meaning of &quot;in&quot;. It allows rooms (and even other regions) to be &quot;in&quot; a region, and it allows indirect containment.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">How Inform decides.</span> So which meaning does Inform use, and when? Since these two meanings are so different, it clearly matters.</p>
<p>The answer is that meaning 1 is always the meaning of &quot;X is in Y&quot; unless Y is explicitly the name of a region. Thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1094" -->
<a id="c1094"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet box is in the Garden Area, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is meaning 2, because &quot;Garden Area&quot; is the name of a region. That seems fair enough, but values are indeed sometimes given names (becoming &quot;variables&quot;, or values &quot;that vary&quot;). Suppose &quot;mystery value&quot; is a name for a value which is an object, but which has different identities at different times. Then Inform reads</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1095" -->
<a id="c1095"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet box is in the mystery value, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>as meaning 1, because whatever &quot;mystery value&quot; is, it isn't explicitly a region name, even if from time to time it might happen to be equal to a region.</p>
<p>That sometimes makes meaning 2 difficult to express. If we ever need it, and this is fairly rare, we can write it like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1096" -->
<a id="c1096"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet box is regionally in the mystery value, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because &quot;regionally in&quot; is always meaning 2 of &quot;in&quot;.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s12"></a>§6.12. A word about nothing</p>
<p>Like &quot;in&quot;, &quot;nothing&quot; has two slightly different meanings, though here there's much less potential for confusion.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Meaning 1.</span> &quot;Nothing&quot; as &quot;no thing&quot;. This is the meaning in sentences like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1097" -->
<a id="c1097"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: a container is bare if nothing is in it.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And similar for conditions like &quot;if the box contains nothing&quot;. It's a word which describes the absence of things: it says that, though there might have been many possible items here, it turned out that there were none.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Meaning 2.</span> &quot;Nothing&quot; as a value. This is much less commonly seen, but sometimes Inform stores a value such as a property (or a variable) which always has to be an object. In some circumstances, &quot;nothing&quot; is then a special value meaning that this is not set at present. For instance,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1098" -->
<a id="c1098"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: a container is impossible if its matching key is nothing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;matching key&quot; property of a container is always an object, but is allowed to be &quot;nothing&quot; when there isn't a matching key anywhere. (If such a container is locked, nobody will ever be able to unlock it.)</p>
<p><span class="boldface">How Inform decides.</span> So which meaning does Inform use, and when? The answer is that it depends on the relationship being talked about. When this is &quot;is&quot;, values are being compared and we are using meaning 2. But when it is any other relationship, like &quot;is in&quot; - which talks about containment - then we are using meaning 1.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s13"></a>§6.13. To be able to see and touch</p>
<p>Two of the adjectives built into Inform are:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1099" -->
<a id="c1099"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;visible&quot; - the player can see this
<br />&quot;touchable&quot; - the player can touch this
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>So we can write descriptions such as &quot;someone visible&quot; or &quot;a touchable container&quot;. We also have adjectives &quot;invisible&quot; and &quot;untouchable&quot;, as might be expected. The visibility adjectives are particularly useful because the following is likely to go wrong:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1100" -->
<a id="c1100"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if Helen is in a dark room, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This tests whether the room is dark, of itself; Helen may in fact be able to see by means of a torch, but the room is still &quot;dark&quot;.</p>
<p>We can also talk about what other people can see and touch:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1101" -->
<a id="c1101"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
something which can be seen by Helen
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are synonymous. Similarly for touch; and we can write such conditions as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1102" -->
<a id="c1102"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if Helen cannot see Agamemnon, ...
<br />if Cressida can see Troilus, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that it is essential to establish who does the seeing and touching: so &quot;something which can be seen&quot; will not be allowed, whereas &quot;something which can be seen by Helen&quot; will.</p>
<p>In fact, inside Inform the adjective &quot;invisible&quot; (for instance) has the following straightforward definition:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1103" -->
<a id="c1103"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: Something is invisible if the player cannot see it.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The exact definitions of visibility and touchability are complicated, because there are so many ways in which vision and touch can be obstructed, but the gist is that they behave as one would expect. Note that in darkness, nothing is visible, and that nobody can see from one room to another. In general anything invisible is also untouchable, but there are a few exceptions to do with being in the dark. Lastly, the player's own body (usually called &quot;yourself&quot; during play) is both visible (in light) and touchable.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s14"></a>§6.14. Adjacent rooms and routes through the map</p>
<p>Another useful adjective built into Inform is &quot;adjacent&quot;. Two rooms are said to be adjacent if there is a map connection between them which does not pass through some barrier such as a door. This is easily tested:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1104" -->
<a id="c1104"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the Hallway is adjacent to the Study ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We usually want to know about the places adjacent to the current scene of the action, so that is what the adjective &quot;adjacent&quot; means when applied to rooms. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1105" -->
<a id="c1105"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if somebody is in an adjacent room, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>As with the case of &quot;visible&quot;, the adjective is a cut-down version of the more general relationship. This often happens: &quot;worn&quot; and &quot;carried&quot;, for instance, imply &quot;by the player&quot; unless something else is specified.</p>
<p>If we want to ask a more direct question, we can obtain specific map connections as follows. (Recall that every map connection leads either to a door, to a room, or to nothing.) If we know which direction we want to look in, then the easiest thing is to use its relation - every direction in the map, say &quot;north&quot;, has its own relation, say &quot;mapped north of&quot;. So:</p>

<p>This phrase produces a direction to take in order to get from A to B by the shortest number of movements between rooms, or produces &quot;nothing&quot; if there is no way through at all. Example:</p>

<p>Best routes are ordinarily forbidden to go through doors, but if the suffix &quot;using doors&quot; is added as an option then any open or openable and unlocked door may be used on the way; and if &quot;using even locked doors&quot; is given, then any door at all will do. Since magnetism is no respecter of property, that seems right here:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1110" -->

<p>In practice this simple approach sometimes produces impossible journeys, rather the way Google Maps directions from New York to London would recommend driving down to the docks and then swimming. A more careful approach is to use:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn64" -->

<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_bestroutethrough -->

<p>This phrase produces a direction to take in order to get from A to B by the shortest number of movements between rooms which match the given description, or produces &quot;nothing&quot; if there is no way through at all. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1111" -->
<a id="c1111"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
best route from the Drawbridge to the Keep through visited rooms
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The condition - in this case, that &quot;visited rooms&quot; must be used - also applies to both ends of the journey, so if either Drawbridge or Keep are unvisited then this is &quot;nothing&quot;. (Similarly, saying something like &quot;...through containers&quot; would mean there is never a route.)</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Lastly, the following phrases can find out how long the journey would be. (They are quite a bit faster than using the &quot;best route...&quot; phrases repeatedly and counting.)</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn65" -->

<!-- definition of ph_bestroutelength -->

<p>This phrase produces the number of map connections which must be followed in order to get from A to B by the shortest number of movements between rooms. If A and B are the same, the answer is 0; if there is no route at all, the answer is -1. Example:</p>

</div>

<p>Route-finding makes it possible to write quite sophisticated conditions concisely. But these sometimes run slowly, because they call for large amounts of computation. How rapidly Inform can find routes depends on which of two methods it uses. Both have advantages - one is fast but needs large amounts of memory, the other is slow but economical. We can choose between them with one of these two use options:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1113" -->
<a id="c1113"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Use fast route-finding.
<br />Use slow route-finding.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If neither is specified, &quot;fast&quot; is used where the project uses the Glulx virtual machine (see the Settings panel), and &quot;slow&quot; on the Z-machine, where memory is tighter. Fast route-finding is ideally suited to situations where dozens of characters are constantly route-finding through the map as they meander around in a landscape.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s15"></a>§6.15. All, each and every</p>
<p>When testing conditions, we normally talk only about specific things, or else ask if a particular circumstance happens:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1114" -->
<a id="c1114"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the oaken door is open
<br />if a woman is carrying an animal
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But we can also use &quot;all&quot;, &quot;each&quot; or &quot;every&quot; to check the whole range:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1115" -->
<a id="c1115"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if each door is open
<br />if anyone is carrying all of the animals
<br />if everybody is in the Dining Room
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform allows other English &quot;determiners&quot; (as they are sometimes called), as well:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1116" -->
<a id="c1116"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if some of the doors are open
<br />if most of the doors are open
<br />if almost all of the doors are open
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are true if at least one case is true, if a majority (any number greater than one half) or at least 80 per cent of the possible cases are true, respectively.</p>
<p>And we can also use &quot;none&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. These three are all ways to say the same thing:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1117" -->
<a id="c1117"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if no door is open
<br />if all of the doors are not open
<br />if none of the doors is open
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>though it may be clearer style to find a positive way of putting things:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1118" -->
<a id="c1118"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if all of the doors are closed
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>All, each and every can be applied to values, too - but only in some cases. For example, suppose we write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1119" -->
<a id="c1119"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. A colour can be found or unfound.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And suppose that, during play, we assign the &quot;found&quot; property to any colour which the player notices on a wall. We might then want to write conditions like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1120" -->
<a id="c1120"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if every colour is found
<br />if most of the colours are found
<br />if any colour is found
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But we always have to bear in mind that Inform might have no reasonable way to decide these questions. It will refuse to allow these, for example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1121" -->
<a id="c1121"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if every number is positive
<br />if any text is palindromic
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(even supposing the adjective &quot;palindromic&quot; has been defined) - there are practically infinitely many possible numbers and texts, so the search cannot sensibly be done.</p>

<!-- END IGNORE -->
<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s16"></a>§6.16. Counting while comparing</p>
<p>Lastly we can also ask for a more specific number of possibilities, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1122" -->
<a id="c1122"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if two women are carrying animals
<br />if at most three doors are open
<br />if fewer than 10 portable containers are closed
<br />if all but two of the devices are switched on
<br />if there are more than six locked doors
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Likewise for &quot;less than&quot;, &quot;at least&quot;, &quot;all except&quot;. Something to watch out for is that</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1123" -->
<a id="c1123"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if two doors are open
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will be found true if there are (say) three open doors: after all, if three doors are open, then certainly two doors are. So this is not quite counting. We can be more precise by writing</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1124" -->
<a id="c1124"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if exactly two doors are open
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;all but&quot; counts - say, &quot;if all but two doors are open&quot; - are exact: if, in fact, all of the doors are open then this will be found false.</p>
<p>We can often use these counting forms with values, too. As with the use of &quot;all&quot;, this is allowed only if the kind of value is one which can reasonably be searched through. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1125" -->
<a id="c1125"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if more than three scenes are happening
<br />if there are more than two non-recurring scenes
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are allowed because the built-in kind of value &quot;scene&quot; (of which much more later on) has only a small number of possible values.</p>
<p>Lastly, note that the &quot;the&quot; in text like &quot;two of the doors&quot; matters: without it, the phrase will not be recognised as a requirement on the number. (This is to make sure that names of things like &quot;two of hearts&quot; are not misinterpreted.)</p>

<p>One of the advantages of descriptions is that we can use them to pick an item randomly from a specified category. (For more on this possibility, see the Change chapter sections on randomness.)</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we wanted to create a mirror in which the player would see some item from the room reflected. We might write</p>

<p>This is the same as &quot;a random thing which is in the location&quot;: phrase &quot;in...&quot; can be used briefly in Inform as it can in English.</p>
<p>But, on a little more thought, we might want to expand on this: the mirror perhaps should reflect not only things that are in the room, but anything that the player can see (even if it's on a supporter or carried by someone). So then we might instead write</p>

<p>A final note: we use &quot;searching&quot; here because Inform understands both SEARCH THING and LOOK IN THING as the searching action, and the player is most likely to type LOOK IN MIRROR in order to see the reflection there. In the absence of an example, we can discover the relationship between actions and their command vocabulary in one of two ways. A complete list of actions and the vocabulary associated with them is available in the Actions index. Alternatively, we can type ACTIONS at a prompt, followed by LOOK IN MIRROR, and get the response</p>

<p>Suppose we're simulating a situation where the player needs to travel through lit areas only, but we want to give him some hints about which way might be safe. Here we'll find our best route through light-filled rooms.</p>
<p>The slightly tricky part is that it's not necessarily easy to tell whether a room has a lamp in it. We may say &quot;if the Crypt is lighted&quot;, but that only tells us whether it has been declared to be inherently lighted or dark, not whether it happens to contain a light source that the player would be able to see if he went in.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get around this is to create an object -- the light-meter; place it in the target location; and check whether it &quot;can see&quot; a lit object. This preserves all the usual rules about open and closed containers, transparency, etc.</p>

<p>An important word of caution: this method would give false negatives if there were a backdrop lightsource, such as the moon, providing light to the Upward Path. This is because backdrops are actually moved around the map by Inform during play, following the player around.
