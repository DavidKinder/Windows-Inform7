<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s2"></a>§8.2. Ships, Trains and Elevators</p>
<p>This section covers vehicles whose interior consists of at least one entire room. Moving into this room constitutes boarding: there is then some pause while it travels: moving out again disembarks at a different location. The only complication arising is how the player controls the journey (by talking to someone? by pressing buttons? by steering?).</p>
<p><span class="boldface">The Unbuttoned Elevator Affair</span> provides the simplest possible whole-room vehicle, which ferries between two fixed points. If you are at one of these, it must be the other one you want to get to, so there is no need for controls.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Dubai</span> is a much more elaborate elevator, with many possible destinations, chosen using buttons inside the elevator.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Empire</span> simulates a train journey. Here there are no controls as such, but the train passes through a sequence of stops spaced apart in time, so the player chooses an exit by getting out at the right moment.</p>
<p>On a very large, slowish craft such as a cruise liner, we are not so much travelling in a vehicle: it's more as if we are visiting a whole building, which becomes our world for the (probably long) duration of the journey. The liner steers around in long, slow curves, changing its orientation in the water, so that (if we think of &quot;north&quot; as a strictly magnetic matter, anyway) north is constantly rotating: something we don't notice on board because our own reference points, provided by the ship itself, stay fixed relative to ourselves. Because of this, some ships in IF are navigated using FORE, AFT, PORT and STARBOARD directions rather than NORTH, EAST, SOUTH and WEST: see <span class="boldface">Fore</span>.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s3"></a>§8.3. Animals</p>
<p>Animals exhibit a wide range of behaviour: much of the chapter on Other Characters applies just as well to animals as to human beings, with the exception of the material on conversation. But two examples here, both fairly simple, show how a fairly convincing domestic pet can be achieved simply by reacting to certain events going on nearby: <span class="boldface">Feline Behavior</span> (a cat) and <span class="boldface">Today Tomorrow</span> (a dog).</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Fido</span> provides a dog which the player can re-name at will.</p>
<p>For animals that we can sit on and ride - a camel or a horse, say - we may want to use the Rideable Vehicles extension by Graham Nelson, which also provides a rideable animal kind.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s4"></a>§8.4. Furniture</p>
<p>Most domestic furniture consists of supporters and containers of one size or another. This means that the simplest furniture needs no elaborate instructions:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13632" -->
<a id="c13632"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The candlestick is on the dining table. The dining table is fixed in place.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<a id="c13634"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The pillow is on the bed. The bed is enterable and fixed in place.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The examples below are therefore mostly ways to get around the usual restrictions on containers (that they only have one interior) and supporters (that they cannot simultaneously be containers as well).</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Yolk of Gold</span> provides a set of drawers, that is, a container with multiple interiors.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">U-Stor-It</span> provides a way to have containers with a lid which is also a supporter.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Swigmore</span> provides a supporter which holds up the player, but has no top surface as such, and cannot hold up anything else. <span class="boldface">Kiwi</span> demonstrates a kind of high shelf, whose objects cannot be seen or used unless the player stands on a ladder.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Princess and the Pea</span> shows how a pile of supporters, each on top of the last, could be managed.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Tamed</span> demonstrates furniture large enough to get inside, or on top of.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Circle of Misery</span> demonstrates a conveyor belt, which can hold multiple items but only brings one of them within the player's reach at a time.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s5"></a>§8.5. Kitchen and Bathroom</p>
<p>Before implementing elaborate mechanisms to handle plumbing, we should pause to ask ourselves: how much of this do we need? Is it really necessary to simulate the complete set of fixtures and fittings?</p>
<p>This turns out to be a little tricky to do, and also rather dull to set out. The example <span class="boldface">Modern Conveniences</span> was actually written as a demonstration of how an extension to Inform might be written to provide a general &quot;kitchens and bathrooms service&quot; for writers, but it contains a nice implementation well worth borrowing. The idea is to provide a &quot;kitchen&quot; kind of room and a &quot;bathroom&quot; kind of room. All kitchens created automatically contain standard kitchen appliances: fridge, freezer, sink with taps, counters, cabinets, and a stovetop with built-in oven. Similarly, all bathrooms will have sinks, baths, cabinets, and toilets, and respond to some standard interactions.</p>
<p>Another common feature of bathrooms is a mirror: <span class="boldface">Versailles</span> demonstrates how to create a simple one.</p>

<p>The problem of implementing an elevator that opens onto a large number of floors often challenges novice interactive fiction authors. It also raises a fundamental design problem -- how to implement a large building in an interesting way. It is tempting to write a hotel with an elevator and innumerable tedious and identical floors just for the sake of realism; in many cases it is a better idea simply to omit any locations that contribute nothing to the story or the play of the game.</p>
<p>In charity, though, let us assume that the author has a legitimate reason for wanting to implement an elevator that opens onto some generic floors. We will go whole-hog, and set this in the world's tallest hotel: Burj al-Arab, Dubai.</p>

There are there are two ways round this -- (i) the cheeky way. When we drop something, the unobtrusive yet ever-vigilant maids pick it up and take it down to the Foyer's lost property office; and (ii) the super-duper way, in which things are moved out of play but with their floor numbers remembered, so that the scenario can be reconstructed each time. (i) is probably in fact the more true-to-life, considering the hotel's boasts about its service, but we will demonstrate both methods.</p>

<a id="c13786_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;Tamed&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c13787_375" -->
<a id="c13787_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Center Ring is a room. The cage is in the Center Ring. A lion is an animal in the cage. The cage is enterable, openable, transparent, and closed.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Notice that we made the cage transparent. Strictly speaking it is not made of transparent materials, but we can see into (or out of) a closed cage due to the gaps between the bars, so that from Inform's point of view a cage behaves much like a large sturdy glass box. (If we really wanted to make a distinction between, say, an airtight container and one with perforations, we could do so, but Inform does not model such nuances by default.) If a container is not transparent, we can see into and out of it only when it is open.</p>
<p>Supporters are a bit more straightforward because there is no circumstance in which they separate the player from the rest of the world:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13788_375" -->
<a id="c13788_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The pedestal is in the Center Ring. It is enterable.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And in fact we can tell Inform that the player starts on the pedestal with this line:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13789_375" -->
<a id="c13789_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player is on a pedestal.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now the player will begin there rather than just in the Center Ring.</p>
<p>This last bit is an entirely unnecessary bit of local color, but if we're going to keep getting into and out of the lion's cage, we ought to expect him to take notice:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13790_375" -->
<a id="c13790_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn when the player is in the cage:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds, say &quot;The lion eyes you with obvious discontent.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;otherwise say &quot;Though the lion does not move, you are aware that it is watching you closely.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Randomness is explained more completely in the chapter on Change, and every turn rules in the chapter on Time.</p>
<p>Finally, we might want a container whose interior is modeled as its own separate room: say, a magician's booth in which volunteers are made to disappear.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13791_375" -->
<a id="c13791_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The magician's booth is a container in Center Ring. &quot;Off to one side is a magician's booth, used in disappearing acts. The exterior is covered with painted gilt stars.&quot; The booth is enterable, open, not openable, and fixed in place.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we create our other location:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13792_375" -->
<a id="c13792_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Inside from the Center Ring is the Starry Vastness.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...which handles the case of the player typing &gt;IN. (We will not assume by default that he wants to get into the cage with the lion, this being obviously perilous.) But we also want to make sure that the player who types &gt;ENTER BOOTH winds up in the same place, so we should add:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13793_375" -->
<a id="c13793_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of entering the magician's booth: try going inside.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c13794_375" -->

<p>Inform's default assumption is that if a player on an enterable object drops something, the dropped article winds up beside him on the same supporter or in the same container. This makes lots of sense for a dais, say, or a king-sized bed. It's a little less sensible if the enterable supporter in question is a bar stool or the like. So suppose we want to add a new kind of supporter called a perch, where everything dropped lands on the floor.</p>
<p>There are actually several ways of implementing this, but one of them is to reach right into the drop action and replace the &quot;standard dropping rule&quot; with a different one of our own invention -- like this:</p>

<p>Suppose we want to write an extension or other portable code which defines a &quot;kitchen&quot; kind of room and a &quot;bathroom&quot; kind of room. All kitchen rooms we create in the future will automatically contain standard kitchen appliances: fridge, freezer, sink with taps, counters, cabinets, and a stovetop with built-in oven. Similarly, all bathrooms will have sinks, baths, cabinets, and toilets, and respond to some standard interactions.</p>
<p>We would do this with a standard assembly:</p>

<p>Now: we're going to want many of the items in our kitchen to have switches, and to handle input sensibly regardless of whether the player types TURN ON STOVE or TURN ON STOVE SWITCH.

<p>This is probably about as far as we want to go in a generic simulation: it is tempting to code up water, drains down which the player can lose objects, sinks that get clogged and overflow, and so on; but the more we embellish in these ways, the more likely the end result would be disruptive to individual games. For right now what we're aiming for is something simple which provides the basic interactions a player might expect in this kind of room, but which does not have any significant implications for the surrounding world model.</p>
<p>A particularly conservative author might even want to make it turn out that the water has been shut off and nothing flows from the taps: in the extension documentation, we might want to include a line or two of example showing how this might be done by changing or removing the relevant rules of our extension.</p>

<p>Now we might put this to work in a short example.</p>
<p>One slight challenge lies in giving these assembled pieces separate descriptions. When we have an assembly that adds parts to objects, we can then talk about (for instance) &quot;the stove's switch&quot; elsewhere in the code. But items that have been assigned rooms are not named in the same way, so we cannot talk about &quot;the Industrial Kitchen's stove&quot; in our code as a way to assign it a description or special behavior. In quite a simple example, we could make the descriptions of the kind simply be the descriptions we want for the individual items:</p>

<p>Or we might even (if we anticipate lots of these kinds of amendments) want to rig up something more complex that finds the descriptions of appliances in a table, rather than relying on their individual description properties. This can all be done, but it is only interesting as long as it remains genuinely labor-saving: that is, as long as the convenience of having the assembly is greater than the annoyance of writing special rules to cover for the automation. In the end, the &quot;kitchen&quot; and &quot;bathroom&quot; room types are likely to be most useful for authors who want to include the standard props but not actually make them a critical part of the game; if stoves and sinks have more of a starring role in the production, authors may be better off coding them or at the very least placing them by hand, as in</p>

<p>All these quirks are things that we (as the extension author) want to think out in advance: we should ideally warn authors about possible pitfalls in using our extension (if we can think of them) and point out ways of customizing the behavior (if there are interesting ways).</p>
