</table><p class="sectionheading"><a id="s1"></a>§3.1. Descriptions</p>
<p>At its simplest, the interactive fiction will be simulating a physical world to explore. The forerunner of today's IF is generally agreed to be a computer simulation by Will Crowther of the exploration of a cave system in the Mammoth and Flint Ridge chain of caves in Kentucky, a part of which might be described in Inform thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c79" -->
<a id="c79"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;Cave Entrance&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c80" -->
<a id="c80"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Cobble Crawl is a room. &quot;You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage. There is a dim light at the east end of the passage.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c81" -->
<a id="c81"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A wicker cage is here. &quot;There is a small wicker cage discarded nearby.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c82" -->
<a id="c82"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Debris Room is west of the Crawl. &quot;You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface. A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west. A note on the wall says, 'Magic word XYZZY'.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c83" -->
<a id="c83"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The black rod is here. &quot;A three foot black rod with a rusty star on one end lies nearby.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c84" -->
<a id="c84"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Above the Debris Room is the Sloping E/W Canyon. West of the Canyon is the Orange River Chamber.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here we sketch in four of Crowther's locations, and two objects: just enough to be able to walk around the caves and pick up the rod and the cage. The text in quotation marks will appear verbatim as paragraphs shown to the player as the caves are explored. The first paragraph, as we have seen, is the title of the work. The other quotations describe the places and objects introduced.</p>
<p>If we play this story, we find that we can type TAKE CAGE or TAKE WICKER CAGE, for instance, but not TAKE SMALL CAGE. Inform saw that we called this &quot;a wicker cage&quot; when it first appeared in the source text, and assumed that the player would call it that, too. (Whereas it didn't look inside the descriptive text to allow for TAKE SMALL CAGE or TAKE DISCARDED CAGE or TAKE NEARBY CAGE.) A small limitation here is that probably only the first 9 letters of each word are read from the player's command. This is plenty for handling the wicker cage and the black rod, but it might be embarrassing at a meeting of the Justice League to find that KISS SUPERHERO and KISS SUPERHEROINE read as if they are the same command.</p>
<p>So we have already found that Inform has made some assumptions about what we want, and imposed some limitations on how much computational effort to go to when the work of IF is finally played. If Inform guesses what we need wrongly, we need to know more advanced features of the language in order to overcome these problems. (We shall see how to change the way the player's commands are read in the chapter on Understanding.)</p>
<p>This is often how Inform works: make the standard way of doing things as simple as possible to describe, but allow almost any behaviour to be altered by more elaborate source text. As an example of that, the player begins in the Cobble Crawl because it was the first room created in the source text, but we could instead have written text like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c85" -->
<a id="c85"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player is in the Cobble Crawl.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>to override that. This can make the source text easier to follow if the rooms are sometimes being created in a less obvious way. For example, if we write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c86" -->
<a id="c86"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The silver bars are in the Y2 Rock Room.
<br />The Cobble Crawl is a room. South of the Crawl is Y2.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then the first room to be created will actually be the Y2 Rock Room, so that's where the player will be starting unless we say otherwise.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s2"></a>§3.2. Rooms and the map</p>
<p>Rooms are joined together at their edges by &quot;map connections&quot;, most of which are pathways in one of the eight cardinal compass directions: north, northeast (written without a hyphen), east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest. We also have up and down, suitable for staircases or ladders. In real life, people are seldom conscious of their compass bearing when walking around buildings, but it makes a concise and unconfusing way for the player to say where to go next, so is generally accepted as a convention of the genre.</p>
<p>Two more directions are provided by Inform: &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot;. These are best used when one location is, say, a meadow and the other is a woodcutter's hut in the middle of it; we might then say</p>
<!-- START CODE "c87" -->
<a id="c87"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Inside from the Meadow is the woodcutter's hut.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;from&quot; is important, as it clarifies that we intend to link two different locations, not to create an item - the hut - in a single location - the meadow.</p>
<p>A problem which sometimes arises when laying out maps is that Inform allows short forms of room names to be used as abbreviations. This is usually a good idea, but has unfortunate results if we write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c88" -->
<a id="c88"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Airport Road is west of the Fish Packing Plant. The Airport is west of the Airport Road.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...because &quot;Airport&quot; is taken as a reference to &quot;Airport Road&quot;, so Inform makes only two locations, one of which supernaturally leads to itself. We can avoid this by writing:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c89" -->
<a id="c89"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Airport Road is west of the Fish Packing Plant. A room called the Airport is west of the Airport Road.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Using &quot;called&quot; is often a good way to specify something whose name might give rise to confusion otherwise. It always makes something new, and it is also neatly concise, because we can establish something's kind and name in the same sentence. As another example, suppose we want to create a room called &quot;South of the Hut&quot;, to south of the Hut. We can't do so like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c90" -->
<a id="c90"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
South of the Hut is a room. South of the Hut is south of the Hut.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...because Inform will read that first sentence as placing a (nameless) room to the south of a room called &quot;Hut&quot;. Once again &quot;called&quot; can save the day:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c91" -->
<a id="c91"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
South of the Hut is a room called South of the Hut.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It is best to use &quot;called&quot; in the simplest way possible, and in particular, best not to use &quot;called&quot; twice in the same sentence. Consider:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c92" -->
<a id="c92"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The kitchen cabinet contains a container called a mixing bowl and a portable supporter called a platter.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It is unlikely that anyone would want to name something &quot;a mixing bowl and a portable supporter called a platter&quot;, but not impossible, and Inform tends not to be a good judge of what is likely.</p>
<p>(If we really want to get rid of this issue once and for all, starting the source text with the use option &quot;Use unabbreviated object names.&quot; will do it, but the effect is drastic. This instructs Inform not to recognise names other than in full. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c93" -->
<a id="c93"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
West of the Kitchen is the Roaring Range. South of the Range is the Pantry.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is ordinarily read by Inform as constructing three rooms (Kitchen, Roaring Range, Pantry); but with this use option set, it makes four (Kitchen, Roaring Range, Range, Pantry), in two disconnected pieces of map. Handle with care.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s3"></a>§3.3. One-way connections</p>
<p>Connections are ordinarily two-way, but do not have to be. One of the map connections in the Mammoth Cave simulation was made by the sentence:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c94" -->
<a id="c94"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Debris Room is west of the Crawl.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Besides reading this sentence at face value, Inform also deduced that the Crawl was probably meant to be east of the Debris Room: in other words, that the path between them is a two-way one. When Inform makes guesses like this, it treats them as being less certain than anything explicitly stated in the source. Inform will quietly overturn its assumption if information comes to hand which shows that it was wrong. That might happen in this case if another sentence read:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c95" -->
<a id="c95"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Hidden Alcove is east of the Debris Room.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These two sentences are not contradictory: Inform allows them both, simply accepting that the world is more complicated than it first assumed. There are relatively few situations where Inform has to make educated guesses, but when it does, it tries always to follow Occam's Razor by constructing the simplest model world consistent with the information in the Source text.</p>
<p>We can even explicitly make a route which turns around as it leads between two rooms:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c96" -->
<a id="c96"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
West of the Garden is south of the Meadow.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If we want to establish a route which cannot be retraced at all, we can specify that a particular direction leads nowhere:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c97" -->
<a id="c97"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
East of the Debris Room is nowhere.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Finally, note that Inform's assumptions about two-way directions are only applied to simple sentences. When the source text seems to be saying something complicated, Inform takes it as a precise description of what's wanted. So, for example, in:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c98" -->
<a id="c98"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Attic is above the Parlour.
<br />The Attic is a dark room above the Parlour.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform makes guesses about the first sentence, and makes a two-way connection; but it accepts the second sentence more precisely, with just a one-way connection.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s4"></a>§3.4. Regions and the index map</p>
<p>Rooms represent individual places to which one can go, but we tend to think of the world around us in larger pieces: we think of a house and a garden, rather than each of the single rooms of the house and all corners of its garden. To Inform a collection of rooms is called a &quot;region&quot;, and we can create one like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c99" -->
<a id="c99"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Arboretum is east of the Botanical Gardens. Northwest of the Gardens is the Tropical Greenhouse.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c100" -->
<a id="c100"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Public Area is a region. The Arboretum and Gardens are in the Public Area.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The real usefulness of creating regions like &quot;Public Area&quot; will only appear later, when we begin defining rules of play which apply in some areas but not others, but in the mean time we can see the effect by turning to the World tab of the Index. In the World Index, Inform draws a map - or at least a stylised attempt at a diagram of the rooms and their connections: this will not always correspond to how we imagine things, but with any luck it should mostly be right.</p>
<p>Rooms are represented by coloured squares, and the colour-coding is done by region. In the above example, the two &quot;Public Area&quot; rooms are coloured green (as it happens); the Greenhouse, since it belongs to no region, is a neutral grey.</p>
<p>Regions can be put inside each other:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c101" -->
<a id="c101"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The University Parks is a region. The Public Area is in the University Parks.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>but they are not allowed to overlap other than by one being entirely inside the other.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s5"></a>§3.5. Kinds</p>
<p>The following description runs to only 33 words, but makes a surprisingly intricate design. It not only places things within rooms, but also places them very specifically with respect to each other:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c102" -->
<a id="c102"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform needs to identify the places and objects being described by the nouns here, and to guess what it can about them. For instance, the pistol can be picked up but not walked inside, whereas the Treehouse is the reverse. (This is obvious to someone who knows what these words mean, less obvious to a computer which does not, but the text contains sufficient clues.) Inform does this by sorting the various nouns into different categories, which are called &quot;kinds&quot;. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c104" -->
<a id="c104"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Garden, Gazebo, Treehouse - <span class="boldface">room</span>
<br />billiards table - <span class="boldface">supporter</span>
<br />cup - <span class="boldface">container</span>
<br />starting pistol - <span class="boldface">thing</span>
<br />East, up (implied by &quot;above&quot;) - <span class="boldface">direction</span>
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(A container is something which can contain other things, and a supporter similarly.) For instance Inform knows that if one thing is in another, then the second thing is either a room or a container, and if one thing is on another, the second thing is a supporter. This worked nicely for the design above, but:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c105" -->
<a id="c105"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Treehouse is a cardboard box.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>results in the cardboard box being made only a &quot;thing&quot;: because nothing has been put inside it, there is no reason for Inform - which does not know what a cardboard box looks like - to guess that it is a &quot;container&quot;. So we need to add:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c106" -->
<a id="c106"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The box is a container.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It is rather clumsy to have to write two sentences like this, so we would normally write this instead:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c107" -->
<a id="c107"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Treehouse is a container called the cardboard box.

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s6"></a>§3.6. Either/or properties</p>
<p>Some containers, like bottles, can be opened: others, like buckets, cannot. If they can be opened, then sometimes they will be open, and sometimes closed. These are examples of properties, which can change during play. The following source sets some properties:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c108" -->
<a id="c108"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The cardboard box is a closed container. The glass bottle is a transparent open container. The box is fixed in place and openable.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>There are only four different properties referred to here. Closed means not open, and vice versa, so these two adjectives both refer to the same property. (As might be expected, when a container is open, one can see inside and place things within, or take them out.) The glass bottle and the box being containers is a matter of their kinds, which is something fundamental and immutable, so &quot;container&quot; does not count as a property.</p>
<p>A &quot;transparent&quot; container is one which we can see inside even when it is closed, and the opposite is an &quot;opaque&quot; container.</p>
<p>The property of being &quot;fixed in place&quot; ensures that the player cannot pick the item up and walk away with it: this is useful for such things as oak trees or heavy furniture. The opposite condition is to be &quot;portable&quot;.</p>
<p>A container which is &quot;openable&quot; can be opened or closed by the player; as might be expected, the opposite is &quot;unopenable&quot;.</p>
<p>With a really large cardboard box, we might imagine that the player could get inside: such a container should be declared &quot;enterable&quot;.</p>

<p>Properties depend very much on kind. It makes no sense to ask whether a room is transparent or opaque, for instance, so Inform will not allow this either to be specified or queried.</p>
<p>Another way that kind influences properties can be seen from an earlier example:</p>

<p>The cup, the pistol and the table are all allowed to have the &quot;fixed in place&quot; property, but in fact only the table actually has it: the cup and the pistol are created as &quot;portable&quot; instead. This is because Inform knows that most things are portable, but that supporters - such as the table - are usually fixed in place. If this assumption is wrong, we need only add the line:</p>

<p>As we have just seen, making something &quot;fixed in place&quot; will prevent it from being picked up or moved. But it remains substantial enough to be described in its own paragraph of text when the player visits its location. This can be unfortunate if it has also been described already in the body of the main description for that location. For instance, if we wrote:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c111" -->
<a id="c111"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Orchard is a room. &quot;Within this quadrille of pear trees, a single gnarled old oak remains as a memory of centuries past.&quot; The gnarled old oak tree is fixed in place in the Orchard.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This would end up describing the oak twice, once in the paragraph about the Orchard, then again in a list of things within it:</p>

<p>We avoid this by making it &quot;scenery&quot; instead of &quot;fixed in place&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c114" -->
<a id="c114"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The gnarled old oak tree is scenery in the Orchard.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Any thing can be scenery, and this does not bar it from playing a part in the story: it simply means that it will be immobile and that it will not be described independently of its room. Being immobile, scenery should not be used for portable objects that are meant to be left out of the room description.</p>
<p>If a supporter is scenery, it may still be mentioned in the room description after all, but only as part of a paragraph about other items, such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c115" -->
<a id="c115"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If the player takes the candlestick and the Times, the teak table will disappear from mention. (Scenery containers do not behave in this way: their contents are assumed to be less immediately visible, and will be mentioned only if the player looks inside them.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s9"></a>§3.9. Backdrops</p>
<p>It is a cardinal rule that nothing can be in more than one place at the same time, but rules were made to be broken, and an exception is allowed for a special kind of thing called a &quot;backdrop&quot;. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c116" -->
<a id="c116"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c117" -->

<!-- START CODE "c118" -->
<a id="c118"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The stream is a backdrop. It is in the Upper Cave and the Rock Pool.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Backdrops are ordinarily in the background: if the sky needed to be referred to in the course of play, it might be represented by a backdrop, for instance. Here we have a stream of water running through two rooms, though it might be any number. Backdrops are always fixed in place.</p>
<p>Backdrops can be put in regions as well as rooms, and if so, then they are present at every room in the given region (or regions), as well as any specific rooms they may also be put into. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c119" -->
<a id="c119"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Outdoors Area is a region. The Moon is a backdrop. The Moon is in the Outdoors Area. The Moon is in the Skylight Room.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The special place &quot;everywhere&quot; can be given as the location of a backdrop to make it omnipresent:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c120" -->
<a id="c120"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The sky is a backdrop. The sky is everywhere.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform assumes that backdrops are also scenery unless told otherwise, so this will not result in messages like &quot;You can also see the sky here.&quot; being included in room descriptions. In the case of the stream above, we could artfully mention it in passing in the room descriptions of the Upper Cave and the Rock Pool.</p>

<p>The properties we have seen so far have all been either/or: either open or closed, either transparent or opaque, either fixed in place or portable, either openable or not openable. However, some properties can have a much wider range of possibilities. For instance, the &quot;description&quot; of a room is the text revealed when the player first enters it, or types &quot;look&quot;. This needs to be textual: Inform would complain if, for instance, we tried to set the description of something to the number 42. We have already seen a concise way to set the description of a room:</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This text appears as a separate paragraph in the text describing the Painted Room. It will continue to be used until the first time player picks the ring up (if this ever happens), so it normally describes things in their original, undisturbed context. (Inform uses an either/or property called &quot;handled&quot; for this: something is &quot;handled&quot; if it has at some point been held by the player.)</p>
<p>Thus when a piece of text stands alone as a sentence in its own right, then this is either the &quot;description&quot; of the most recently discussed room, or the &quot;initial appearance&quot; of the most recently discussed thing. Either way, it is used verbatim as a paragraph in the text shown to the player visiting the room in question.</p>
<p>But a thing also has an ordinary &quot;description&quot;, which is used to give a close-up look at it. This text is ordinarily only revealed to the player when a command like &quot;examine ring&quot; is keyed in:</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s12"></a>§3.12. Doors</p>
<p>The map of an interactive fiction is the layout of rooms and the entrances and exits which connect them. So far, these map connections have always run from one room to another, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c126" -->
<a id="c126"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Painted Room is north of the Undertomb.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>However, we can also interpose doors between rooms, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c127" -->
<a id="c127"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The heavy iron grating is east of the Orchard and west of the Undertomb. The grating is a door.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The second sentence is needed since otherwise Inform will take &quot;heavy iron grating&quot; to be the name of a third room, whereas what we want is for the grating to be something physically present in both the Orchard and in the Undertomb, and acting as a conduit between them. To this end it needs to be a &quot;door&quot;, a kind we have not so far seen. In the absence of any other instruction, a newly created door will be fixed in place, closed and openable.</p>
<p>The grating really does come in between the two rooms: the grating is what lies immediately east of the Orchard, not the Undertomb room. So if we wrote the following:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c128" -->
<a id="c128"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Undertomb is east of the Orchard. The heavy iron grating is east of the Orchard and west of the Undertomb. The grating is a door.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then Inform would say that this is a contradiction: we said the Undertomb was east of the Orchard, but then we said that the grating was east of the Orchard.</p>
<p>Inform's &quot;door&quot; kind can be used for all manner of conduits, so the word door need not be taken literally. In Ursula K. Le Guin's beguiling novel &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, from which the above rooms are stolen, it is not a grating which interposes, but: </p>
<!-- START CODE "c129" -->
<a id="c129"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The red rock stair is east of the Orchard and above the Undertomb. The stair is an open door. The stair is not openable.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In real life, most doors are two-sided, and can be used from either of the rooms which they join, but this is not always convenient for interactive fiction. Here is a one-sided door:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c130" -->
<a id="c130"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The blue door is a door. It is south of Notting Hill. Through it is the Flat Landing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Note the use of &quot;it&quot; here as an optional abbreviation.) This will make a door visible only on the Notting Hill side; no map connection will be made in the reverse direction, unless we ask for one.</p>
<p>So much for creating and describing individual doors. Once we need to write about doors in general, we are likely to want a way to find out where a given door sits in the map. The following phrases reveal this:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn0" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn0"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>front side of </b>(object)<b> ... room</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_frontside -->

<p>This phrase produces the first of the one or two rooms containing a door - first in the order given in the source text. Example: if</p>

<p>It seems unwise for a door in Notting Hill to be unlocked, so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c135" -->
<a id="c135"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The blue door is lockable and locked. The matching key of the blue door is the brass Yale key.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Since the second sentence here is a little clumsy, we can equivalently say</p>
<!-- START CODE "c136" -->
<a id="c136"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The brass Yale key unlocks the blue door.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Yet a third way to say this is:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c137" -->
<a id="c137"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The blue door has matching key the brass Yale key.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This introduces three new properties: a door can be locked or unlocked; lockable or not lockable; and it can have a matching key, which must be another thing. The same thing can be the matching key of many different locks: and note that a door can be locked and even lockable without having a matching key at all, in which case the player trying to open it will be permanently out of luck. Doors are ordinarily unlocked, not lockable, and without a matching key.</p>
<p>Containers can also have locks, in exactly the same way, and are allowed to have the same properties. On the other hand supporters never have locks: it makes no sense to be able to lock a tabletop, for instance, and Inform will not allow any discussion of the matching key of a supporter, or of a supporter being locked or unlocked.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s14"></a>§3.14. Devices and descriptions</p>
<p>A &quot;device&quot; is another of the standard kinds of thing, and should be used for anything which can be switched on or off: a light switch, say, or a slide projector. Devices are generally machines, clockwork or electrical. A device is always either &quot;switched on&quot; or &quot;switched off&quot;, but is switched off unless we specify otherwise.</p>
<p>That makes three kinds of thing which will likely change their appearance according to which of their two possible states they are in: doors and containers, which can be open or closed; and devices, which can be switched on or switched off. We would like to produce text accordingly, and we can do this using Inform's ability to make (almost) any piece of text change with circumstances. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c138" -->
<a id="c138"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The coffin is an openable container in the Undertomb. &quot;[if open]The lid of a plank coffin yawns open.[otherwise]A plank coffin lies upon the dirt floor of the Tomb.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We could use a similar trick to make the appearance of a device change &quot;if switched on&quot;. There will be much more about text substitutions, as instructions in square brackets like these are called, in later chapters.</p>

<p>Rooms can be &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;lighted&quot;, though they are lighted by default, and are lighted in all the examples we have seen so far.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c139" -->
<a id="c139"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Sinister Cave is a dark room. &quot;A profoundly disquieting rock formation, apparently sculptured by some demonic hand, this is not a cave in which to relax.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>When the player is in a dark room, he can still go in various directions, but he cannot see the room description or interact with any of the objects in the room, except those he is holding. This means that, unless we should change the Cave in some way during play, the text above (&quot;A profoundly...&quot;) will only be read if the player succeeds in bringing light into the Cave, perhaps by bringing along the following:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c140" -->
<a id="c140"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The flaming torch is in the Sandy Passage. &quot;Stuck loosely into the sand is a flaming torch.&quot; The flaming torch is lit.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A thing with the property of being &quot;lit&quot; will enable the player to see inside dark rooms, and to carry out other activities requiring light, such as examining items. A lit thing in an open container will still light up a room; a lit thing in a closed container will not, unless the container has been given the &quot;transparent&quot; property.</p>
<p>It is possible to adjust the way darkness behaves, and we will see more on this topic in the chapter on Activities.</p>

<p>Next in the tour of standard kinds is the &quot;vehicle&quot;. This behaves like (indeed, is) an enterable container, except that it will not be portable unless this is specified.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c141" -->
<a id="c141"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The player can enter the sports car and then move around riding inside it, by typing directions exactly as if on foot: and the story will print names of rooms with &quot;(in the red sports car)&quot; appended, lest this be forgotten.</p>
<p>We have already seen that some things are portable, others fixed in place. In fact we can also make a third sort of thing: those which, although not portable, can be pushed from one room to another with commands like &quot;push the wheelbarrow north&quot;. At a pinch, we might just be willing to allow:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c142" -->
<a id="c142"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The red sports car is pushable between rooms.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But of course this is a property which almost any thing can have, not just a vehicle. (Only &quot;almost&quot; because Inform will not allow a door to be pushable between rooms, in the interests of realism rather than surrealism.)</p>
<p>If we need vehicles which the passenger sits on top of, like a horse or a tractor, the standard &quot;vehicle&quot; kind will not be ideal. However, by loading one of the extensions which comes ready-installed:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c143" -->
<a id="c143"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...we are provided with two more kinds, &quot;rideable vehicle&quot; and &quot;rideable animal&quot;, just right for the tractor and the horse respectively. (As with all extensions, the documentation can be seen by clicking Go on some source which contains the above line, and then turning to the Contents index; or from the Installed Extensions tab of the Extensions panel.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s17"></a>§3.17. Men, women and animals</p>
<p>Rounding out the standard kinds provided by Inform are four for living things: &quot;person&quot;, which is a kind of thing, and &quot;man&quot;, &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;animal&quot;, all kinds of person. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c144" -->
<a id="c144"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Ballroom is a man called Mr Darcy.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>For the time being, men and women will be little more than waxworks: they will come to life only when we go beyond the present stage of creating an initial state of the world.</p>
<p>People can be male or female: this is an either/or property for the &quot;person&quot; kind, and it affects play at run-time a little, because the player can use &quot;him&quot; and &quot;her&quot; to refer to male or female people encountered. Men and women are always male and female respectively, and for animals we can choose either way, for example making a stallion male or a nanny goat female. Animals are male unless we say otherwise.</p>
<p>If our animal is instead something like a beetle or an earthworm, where gender doesn't seem to matter or even to exist, we can use the further property &quot;neuter&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c145" -->
<a id="c145"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The spider is a neuter animal in the Bathroom.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The Standard Rules don't make people behave differently according to their genders, and the main difference comes down to language: whether we want the animal to be called &quot;her&quot;, or &quot;it&quot;. Because of the existence of &quot;neuter&quot;, we sometimes need to be cautious about the use of the adjective &quot;male&quot;: since Inform, partly for historical reasons, uses an either/or property for masculinity, neuter animals are also &quot;male&quot;.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s18"></a>§3.18. Articles and proper names</p>
<p>Suppose we have said that:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c146" -->
<a id="c146"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Ballroom is a man called Mr Darcy.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>When the Ballroom is visited, the man is listed in the description of the room as &quot;Mr Darcy&quot;, not as &quot;a Mr Darcy&quot;. This happened not because Inform recognised that Darcy is a proper name, or even because men tend to have proper names, but because Inform noticed that we did not use &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;the&quot; or &quot;some&quot; in the sentence which created him. The following shows most of the options:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c147" -->
<a id="c147"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Belfry is a room. A bat is in the Belfry. The bell is in the Belfry. Some woodworm are in the Belfry. A man called William Snelson is in the Belfry. A woman called the sexton's wife is in the Belfry. A man called a bellringer is in the Belfry.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c148" -->
<a id="c148"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Belfry is a man called the vicar. The indefinite article of the vicar is &quot;your local&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In the resulting story, we read:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c149" -->
<a id="c149"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
You can see a bat, a bell, some woodworm, William Snelson, the sexton's wife, a bellringer and your local vicar here.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The subtlest rule here is in the handling of &quot;the&quot;. We wrote &quot;The bell is in the Belfry&quot;, but this did not result in the bell always being called &quot;the&quot; bell: in fact, writing &quot;A bell is in the Belfry&quot; would have had the same effect. On the other hand, &quot;A woman called the sexton's wife is in the Belfry.&quot; led to the wife always being known as &quot;the&quot; sexton's wife, not &quot;a&quot; sexton's wife, because Inform thinks the choice of article after &quot;called&quot; shows more of our intention than it would elsewhere. These rules will never be perfect in all situations, so we are also allowed to specify indefinite articles by hand, as the vicar's case shows.</p>
<p>&quot;Some&quot; is worth a closer look, because English uses it in several different ways. By introducing the woodworm with &quot;some&quot;, above, we established that it was plural. We might imagine that there are many worms, even though they are represented by a single thing in Inform. We can expect to see text in the story such as:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c150" -->
<a id="c150"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
You can see some woodworm here.
<br />The woodworm are fixed in place.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But suppose we wanted something which there is an amount of, but which is not made up of individual items - a so-called mass noun like &quot;water&quot;, or &quot;bread&quot;. Now we can write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c151" -->
<a id="c151"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The water is here. The indefinite article is &quot;some&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and this time Inform does not treat the &quot;some water&quot; thing as a plural, so we might read:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c152" -->
<a id="c152"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
You can see some water here.
<br />The water is hardly portable.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>rather than &quot;The water are hardly portable.&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, we can override these settings, if they still come out not as we intend, by explicitly changing the either/or properties &quot;singular-named&quot; (vs &quot;plural-named&quot;) and &quot;proper-named&quot; (vs &quot;improper-named&quot;).</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s19"></a>§3.19. Carrying capacity</p>
<p>The containers and supporters created so far have been boundlessly capacious: or rather, though we seldom notice the difference, have had a maximum carrying capacity of 100 items. This is clearly unrealistic for a small purse or a modest mantelpiece. We can impose upper limits with sentences like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c153" -->
<a id="c153"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The carrying capacity of the jewelled purse is 2.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c154" -->
<a id="c154"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The bijou mantelpiece has carrying capacity 3.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Attempts by the player to overfill, or overload, will now be rebuffed with a message such as &quot;There is no room on the mantelpiece&quot;.</p>
<p>The player is not a container or a supporter, but nevertheless does have a carrying capacity: this is interpreted to mean the maximum number of items which can be carried at once.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c155" -->
<a id="c155"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The carrying capacity of the player is 4.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These restrictions only apply to the player (and other in-world characters): as the omnipotent creators, we are not restrained by them. Nothing prevents this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c156" -->
<a id="c156"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The carrying capacity of the jewelled purse is 2. The diamond, the ruby and the sapphire are in the purse.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The player will be able to remove all three items, but only put two of them back. (This is probably something we only want very occasionally: perhaps to create a sack stuffed almost to bursting point.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s20"></a>§3.20. Possessions and clothing</p>
<p>We have seen how to place objects in rooms, and in containers or on supporters. But what about people? Perhaps it could be said that they &quot;contain&quot; the fillings in their teeth, or &quot;support&quot; a top hat, but this is not very natural. Inform therefore never speaks of things being &quot;in&quot; or &quot;on&quot; people. Instead, they have two sorts of possessions: the things they carry, and the things they wear. (Body parts, such as arms and legs, are different again: see &quot;parts&quot; below for a clue to how to do these.) Thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c157" -->
<a id="c157"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Mr Darcy wears a top hat. Mr Darcy carries a silver sword.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In fact, Inform deduces from this not only who owns the hat and the sword, but also that Darcy has the kind &quot;person&quot;, because only people can wear or carry.</p>
<p>As all the assertion verbs do, &quot;to wear&quot; and &quot;to carry&quot; have participles which Inform knows about. So we could equally well write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c158" -->
<a id="c158"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The scarlet coat is worn by Mr Wickham. The duelling pistol is carried by Mr Wickham.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If we do not specify who does the wearing, or carrying, then this is assumed to be the player. Thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c159" -->
<a id="c159"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A brass lantern and a rusty iron key are carried. The mosquito-repellent hat is worn.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It would make no sense to &quot;wear&quot; the key, for instance, so Inform needs to distinguish between what is clothing and what is not. It does this with an either/or property called &quot;wearable&quot;: if something has this property then the player will be allowed to wear it, provided it can first be picked up. Anything which is worn by somebody at the start of play is assumed to be wearable (unless we say otherwise). But if nobody is initially wearing the item in question, then we have to be explicit:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c160" -->
<a id="c160"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player carries a scarlet gown. The gown is wearable.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(When we come to asking questions about the current situation, we will need to remember that &quot;to carry&quot; and &quot;to wear&quot; are different. Thus &quot;if Lancelot carries the plate armour&quot; will not be true if he is wearing it rather than carrying it under his arm. As we will later see, we can instead vaguely say &quot;if Lancelot has the plate armour&quot; to mean either carrying or wearing.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s21"></a>§3.21. The player's holdall</p>
<p>When the player has only limited carrying capacity, play is likely to be tiresome, but we can make life easier by providing a way for the player to carry endless items without dozens of free hands to hold them all:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c161" -->
<a id="c161"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This example story introduces a new kind of container, the &quot;player's holdall&quot;. This is a kind of which most stories will contain at most one example, but in principle there can be any number. A player's holdall is a capacious bag into which the player automatically places surplus items whenever his or her hands are full: trying the above example story and getting the items one by one will give the general idea.</p>
<p>Of course, if the carrying capacity of the player is never reached then there will never be any surplus items and a player's holdall will behave just like any other (portable, usually openable) container.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s22"></a>§3.22. Food</p>
<p>We have nearly reached the end of the chapter on Things, but one either/or property for things remains: every thing is either &quot;edible&quot; or &quot;inedible&quot;. Unless we say otherwise, things are inedible. But for instance we might write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c165" -->
<a id="c165"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(The type of computer is named after a variety of apple descended from a tree cultivated in 1811 by John McIntosh of Ontario.) Edible things are just like inedible ones, except that the player can EAT them. This will usually only consume the foodstuff in question, effectively destroying it, but using techniques from later chapters we could make the consequences more interesting.</p>

How might we simulate a car with an ignition key, given that no single thing can be both a &quot;vehicle&quot; and a &quot;device&quot; at the same time?</p>
<p>The Inform world model takes the view that such a car is too complicated to be simulated with a single thing. Instead it should be simulated as a vehicle (the car) which has a device (the ignition) attached. This is done using a third kind of containment to those seen so far (&quot;in...&quot; and &quot;on...&quot;): &quot;part of&quot;.</p>

<p>In the interests of realism, the standard rules of play protect these composite things.

<p>Note that rooms and regions are not allowed to have parts. (Rooms are already parts of regions, and to divide up rooms, we can either make several rooms or place containers or other obstacles in a single one.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s24"></a>§3.24. Concealment</p>
<p>Though realism can become tiresome in interactive fiction, there are times when we cannot go along with Inform's normal assumption that all of a person's possessions are visible to everybody else. People are not like containers, which either show all of their holdings or not, according to whether they are open or transparent. If a man is carrying a fishing rod and a wallet, one will be on open show, the other not. Some clothing is outwardly visible, but not all.</p>
<p>Whether or not something is concealed is not like the either/or properties we have seen so far - such as being &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; - because it is not really a property of the thing itself, but depends on the habitual behaviour of its current owner. To talk about behaviour we have to use sentences of a kind not seen so far, and which will not fully be explained for some chapters to come.</p>
<p>But straightforward cases are easy to write, if only by imitating the following examples.</p>
<p>Here we make the Cloaked Villain invariably conceal anything she is holding or wearing:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c172" -->
<a id="c172"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of the Cloaked Villain: yes.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>At which point we think about it more carefully, and then rewrite:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c173" -->
<a id="c173"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of the Cloaked Villain: if the particular possession is the sable cloak, no; otherwise yes.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(A rule which says neither &quot;yes&quot; nor &quot;no&quot; will decide yes, but it's best to spell out exactly what's wanted.)</p>
<p>Parts are treated exactly as if clothes or items being held, and the following will make the face and inscription on a coin invisible unless the player is holding it - the idea being that they are too small to be seen from farther away.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c174" -->
<a id="c174"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The coin is in the Roman Villa. The face and inscription are parts of the coin. Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of the coin: if the coin is carried, no; otherwise yes.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>There is also an either/or property called &quot;described&quot;/&quot;undescribed&quot;, intended to be used only as a last resort, but which has the ability to hide something from room descriptions. This not really hiding: the idea is that &quot;undescribed&quot; should be used only for cases where some other text already reveals the item, or where its presence is implicit. Even then, it should only be used when the item is intended to be taken or moved by the player at some point - if the item isn't intended to move, it's much better to make it &quot;scenery&quot;. (There's only one commonly-found example - the player's own body, the &quot;yourself&quot;, is undescribed.)</p>
<p>Note that the &quot;undescribed&quot; property is automatically removed from anything carried by, worn by or part of the player, even indirectly; and that nothing on top of an &quot;undescribed&quot; supporter will be visible in a room description, even if it itself is &quot;described&quot;. (Scenery supporters don't suffer from that restriction, which is one reason scenery is a better option when possible.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s25"></a>§3.25. The location of something</p>
<p>The model world created by Inform is partitioned into rooms. This means that everything which exists in the model world, exists in one of the rooms. If we write a sentence such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c175" -->
<a id="c175"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Professor Wilderspin is a man.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and say nothing more about Wilderspin, then he does not physically exist at the start of the story: he is said to be &quot;out of play&quot;, and stays that way until we move him into one of the rooms. A better metaphor might be that he is waiting in the wings, ready to come onto the stage.</p>
<p>Every thing is either out of play, or can be found in one of the rooms, and the property &quot;location of X&quot; gives us the room in question. The following condition tests, in effect, whether Wilderspin is in play:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c176" -->
<a id="c176"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the location of Wilderspin is a room, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Which uses a new phrase:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn4" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn4"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>location of </b>(object)<b> ... room</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_locationof -->

<p>This phrase produces the room which, perhaps indirectly, contains the object given. Example: if the player stands in Biblioll College and wears a waistcoat, inside which is a fob watch, then</p>
<!-- START CODE "c177" -->
<a id="c177"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
location of the fob watch
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is Biblioll College. In general, a thing cannot be in two rooms at once, but there are two exceptions: two-sided doors, present on both sides, and backdrops. The &quot;location of&quot; a door is its front side, but a backdrop has no location. (Objects which are not things at all, such as rooms and directions, also have no location.)</p>

<!-- end definition -->

<p>We very often want to know the location of the player, and this is more simply called just &quot;the location&quot;. (This is actually a value that varies rather than a phrase, but that's a technicality we can ignore here.)</p>
<p>The idea of indirect containment is useful enough to have a name: Inform calls it &quot;enclosure&quot;. A thing encloses whatever is a part of itself, or inside itself, or on top of itself, and it also encloses anything that they enclose. And when something moves around, anything it encloses will move with it. In the example above, Biblioll College (a room) and the player (a person) both enclose the fob watch and the waistcoat. (The small print: a door is enclosed by the rooms on both sides; a backdrop is never enclosed.)</p>
<p>Enclosure is only useful when being used as a question. So the following is fine:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c178" -->
<a id="c178"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player encloses the fob watch, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But these will produce problem messages:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c179" -->
<a id="c179"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player encloses the fob watch. The location of the trilobite is the Museum.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because they are too vague. Inform needs to know exactly where the fob watch and the trilobite will begin the story, whereas these sentences leave room for doubt about who or what is actually holding them.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s26"></a>§3.26. Directions</p>
<p>&quot;Direction&quot; is a kind which is quite unlike most of those seen so far. While it has to do with the physical world, a direction does not exactly belong to it. One cannot find &quot;southeast&quot; sitting on a shelf. &quot;Direction&quot; is not a kind of thing, nor a kind of room: it is a kind in its own right.</p>
<p>Every direction has an &quot;opposite&quot; property, which is always another direction. These occur in matched pairs. The opposite of north is south, just as the opposite of south is north. The opposite of southeast is northwest, the opposite of inside is outside, and so on. When Inform reads a sentence like...</p>
<!-- START CODE "c180" -->
<a id="c180"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Bangkok is south of Nakhon Sawan.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...it assumes that the opposite map connection is probably also valid, so that</p>
<!-- START CODE "c181" -->
<a id="c181"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Nakhon Sawan is north of Bangkok.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The chapter began with the twelve directions built into Inform:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c182" -->
<a id="c182"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, down, inside, outside
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But the built-in set is not always appropriate. Sometimes this is too many; if we wanted to write about a Flatland, for instance, then up and down ought to go. But in practice it is better not to abolish them as directions but instead to forbid travelling in them. (See the Recipe Book for examples.)</p>
<p>But away from our familiar Earth, the usual frame of reference loses its meaning. Terry Pratchett's &quot;Discworld&quot; comedies, set on a rotating disc, use the directions turnwise, widdershins, hubwards and rimwards. On board a Zeppelin airship, which constantly changes its course, the cockpit has no fixed compass bearing from the passenger cabin: it is not very naturally &quot;north&quot;. In zero gravity, there is no up or down. Mars does not have a magnetic core, so a compass doesn't work there.</p>
<p>New directions must always be created in opposing pairs, and each <span class="boldface">must</span> be declared with a clear simple sentence of the form &quot;X is a direction.&quot; For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c183" -->
<a id="c183"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Turnwise is a direction. The opposite of turnwise is widdershins.
<br />Widdershins is a direction. The opposite of widdershins is turnwise.
<br />Hubwards is a direction. The opposite of hubwards is rimwards.
<br />Rimwards is a direction. The opposite of rimwards is hubwards.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It is then possible to write, say, that:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c184" -->
<a id="c184"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Ankh-Morpork is hubwards of Lancre and turnwise from Borogravia.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Of course the Map page of the Index for the project normally draws a map based on compass bearings, so it will get a little befuddled by this. But the map drawn in the Index can be given hints to improve its legibility. More on this later, but for now note that</p>
<!-- START CODE "c185" -->
<a id="c185"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Index map with turnwise mapped as east.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>maps turnwise directions as if they were east, that is, pointing rightwards on the page. (This has no effect on the story file produced; it does not mean turnwise is simply a new name for east; it affects only the look of the Index map, which is only a convenience for the author in any case.)</p>
<p>At one time, directions had to have shortish names (up to three words only), but that's no longer true:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c186" -->
<a id="c186"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Just the tiniest smidge off magnetic north is a direction. The opposite of
<br />just the tiniest smidge off magnetic north is just the tiniest smidge
<br />off magnetic south.
<br />Just the tiniest smidge off magnetic south is a direction. The opposite of
<br />just the tiniest smidge off magnetic south is just the tiniest smidge
<br />off magnetic north.

<p>On a device with very limited screen space, however, we might wish to supplant that behavior with &quot;brief&quot; descriptions.

(Though if we do decide that we want players to have access to a printed map while they play, Inform can help: we will return to the layout of Port Royal in the chapter on Publishing.)</p>
<p>The following Test command allows us to type TEST ME and explore the map we just devised:</p>

<p>Sometimes when a player moves from one room to another, we want to imply that a considerable amount of time elapses, or that something interesting occurs on the way.

<p>Sometimes we may want a room to be visible from the outside in one location, but treated as a separate location when we are inside. The simplest way to do this is to make the exterior form of the object into a door object, and to describe it differently from different vantage points. (Doors in general are described more fully in the Doors section of the Things chapter.)</p>

<p>Here we've arranged for the booth to be described in the initial room description in different ways depending on where the player is when viewing it. We might like to do the same if the player takes a closer look:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c226_359" -->

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A final nice touch, if we're so inclined, is to borrow from the Basic Actions chapter and make the player automatically open the booth door before trying to enter:</p>

<p>If we check out a map of historic Port Royal, we find that Thames Street End bends around the northwest tip of the peninsula and becomes the (very) roughly north/south Fisher's Row. We can't put Fisher's Row south of Thames Street End, though, because Lime Street is already going that way. So instead, let's have a map connection that bends around from west to north:</p>

<p>Now continuing west along Thames Street, or north along Fisher's Row, will bring us around the corner in question. Asymmetric map connections should be used carefully. They're good for representing the layout of the real world, which tends not to be laid out on a convenient square matrix, but if exits are not described clearly they can be disorienting for the player.

<p>Within a room, we might have containers and supporters that a player can enter. A chair, stool, table, dais, or pedestal would be an enterable supporter (anything we would describe a person as being &quot;on&quot;); a cage, hammock, or booth would be an enterable container (because we would describe the person as being &quot;inside&quot;).</p>
<p>When the player is in or on something, he is able to see the rest of the contents of the room, but a note such as &quot;(in the hammock)&quot; or &quot;(on the poster bed)&quot; is added to the room title when he looks around.</p>
<p>Here is an example to show off the possibilities:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c280_375" -->
<a id="c280_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;Tamed&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c281_375" -->
<a id="c281_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Center Ring is a room. The cage is in the Center Ring. A lion is an animal in the cage. The cage is enterable, openable, transparent, and closed.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Notice that we made the cage transparent. Strictly speaking it is not made of transparent materials, but we can see into (or out of) a closed cage due to the gaps between the bars, so that from Inform's point of view a cage behaves much like a large sturdy glass box. (If we really wanted to make a distinction between, say, an airtight container and one with perforations, we could do so, but Inform does not model such nuances by default.) If a container is not transparent, we can see into and out of it only when it is open.</p>
<p>Supporters are a bit more straightforward because there is no circumstance in which they separate the player from the rest of the world:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c282_375" -->
<a id="c282_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The pedestal is in the Center Ring. It is enterable.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And in fact we can tell Inform that the player starts on the pedestal with this line:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c283_375" -->
<a id="c283_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player is on a pedestal.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now the player will begin there rather than just in the Center Ring.</p>
<p>This last bit is an entirely unnecessary bit of local color, but if we're going to keep getting into and out of the lion's cage, we ought to expect him to take notice:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c284_375" -->
<a id="c284_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn when the player is in the cage:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds, say &quot;The lion eyes you with obvious discontent.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;otherwise say &quot;Though the lion does not move, you are aware that it is watching you closely.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Randomness is explained more completely in the chapter on Change, and every turn rules in the chapter on Time.</p>
<p>Finally, we might want a container whose interior is modeled as its own separate room: say, a magician's booth in which volunteers are made to disappear.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c285_375" -->
<a id="c285_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The magician's booth is a container in Center Ring. &quot;Off to one side is a magician's booth, used in disappearing acts. The exterior is covered with painted gilt stars.&quot; The booth is enterable, open, not openable, and fixed in place.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we create our other location:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c286_375" -->
<a id="c286_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Inside from the Center Ring is the Starry Vastness.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...which handles the case of the player typing &gt;IN. (We will not assume by default that he wants to get into the cage with the lion, this being obviously perilous.) But we also want to make sure that the player who types &gt;ENTER BOOTH winds up in the same place, so we should add:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c287_375" -->
<a id="c287_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of entering the magician's booth: try going inside.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c288_375" -->
<a id="c288_375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Test me with &quot;get in cage / open cage / get in cage / z / close cage / out / open cage / get on pedestal / get off / look / enter booth / out&quot;.

&quot;Disenchantment Bay&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>There are many Disenchantment Bays across the world, named by eighteenth-century ships' captains - one in Antarctica, another in Tasmania, for instance. The most famous is probably the one where Lewis and Clark's expedition broke through to the Pacific. But ours is the one in Alaska, named in 1791 by a Spanish navigator who had hoped it might lead to the fabled Northwest Passage, and all of this history is beside the point since the game is set in the present day.</p>

The Cabin is a room.  &quot;The front of the small cabin is entirely occupied with navigational instruments, a radar display, and radios for calling back to shore.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now Inform will have guessed that the case is a container, but its default idea of a container is something like a bucket: permanently open and not able to be opened and shut. We can change that:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c293_48" -->
<a id="c293_48"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Using &quot;some&quot; rather than &quot;a&quot; or &quot;the&quot; tells Inform that the cushions are to be referred to as a plural object in the future. And because of the &quot;on the bench...&quot; phrase, Inform will guess that the bench is a supporter and that it is fixed in place and cannot be moved from room to room. We do have to tell it that the bench can be sat on, though:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c295_48" -->

<p>The door and the view will need to be done as well, but they are special cases which we will get to shortly.</p>
<p>As noted, making something scenery also means that the player will be prevented from picking it up and carrying it away. This is sensible, though: if an object can be removed from the room where it first appears, we should be careful about mentioning it in the main room description; otherwise, it will continue to be described as present even when someone has carried it off.</p>

<div class="egpanel" id="example219">
<p>Occasionally it is useful to give something a printed name because we want to call it something extremely long-winded; give one thing a name that is the subset of the name of something else; or use words such as &quot;with&quot; or &quot;and&quot; that are likely to confuse Inform into thinking that the object name ends before it actually does.</p>
<p>Often it is enough to preface these ambiguously-titled things with &quot;a thing called...&quot; or &quot;a supporter called...&quot; or the like, as here:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c322_219" -->
<a id="c322_219"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
South of Spring Rolls is a room called Hot and Sour Soup.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>prevents Inform from trying to read &quot;Hot and Sour Soup&quot; as two separate rooms, while</p>
<!-- START CODE "c323_219" -->
<a id="c323_219"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player carries an orange ticket. The player carries a thing called an orange.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>creates two objects instead of the one orange ticket that would result if the second sentence were merely &quot;The player carries an orange.&quot;</p>
<p>Really long names can be a bit cumbersome. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c324_219" -->
<a id="c324_219"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player carries a thing called an incriminating photograph of a woman with blonde hair.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>So we might instead give the photograph a printed name:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c325_219" -->
<a id="c325_219"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;Laura&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c326_219" -->
<a id="c326_219"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The City of Angels is a room. The incriminating photograph is carried by the player. The printed name of the incriminating photograph is &quot;incriminating photograph of a woman with blonde hair&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we've gotten around any awkwardness with printing the name -- but we also need to understand when the player refers to the photograph. When we define the names of objects under normal circumstances, Inform takes care of this automatically, but if we have especially set the printed name, we must also specially define the appropriate terms for the player to use. For this we need &quot;understand&quot;, which will be explained in much more depth in a later chapter:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c327_219" -->
<a id="c327_219"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;with&quot; or &quot;blonde&quot; or &quot;hair&quot; or &quot;of&quot; or &quot;a&quot; as the incriminating photograph.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c328_219" -->
<a id="c328_219"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Test one with &quot;x photograph / x incriminating photograph of a woman with blonde hair / x hair / x blonde / x woman with blonde hair / x incriminating photograph of a woman&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That's probably as far as we really need to go, and if you are satisfied with this behavior, there is no need to read on.</p>
<p>One possible objection to this solution is that Inform will accept some nonsensical formulations as applying to the photograph: for instance, it will allow &gt;EXAMINE PHOTOGRAPH OF, &gt;X BLONDE PHOTOGRAPH WOMAN INCRIMINATING, or even &gt;X OF ...though in the case there were two items with &quot;of&quot; names, the game would disambiguate with a question such as &quot;Which do you mean, the incriminating photograph of a woman with blonde hair or the essence of wormwood?&quot;</p>
<p>Traditionally, Inform has tended to be fairly flexible about word order, preferring to err in the direction of leniency. On the other hand, there are times when we need more exacting rules in order to distinguish otherwise similar cases.</p>
<p>Two features allow us to specify more exactly if we so desire. The first is that, if we specify a whole phrase as the name of something, all the words in that phrase are required, in the order given. Thus &quot;Understand &quot;blonde hair&quot; as the photograph&quot; would require that both &quot;blonde&quot; and &quot;hair&quot; be present, and would not recognize &gt;X BLONDE, &gt;X HAIR BLONDE, or &gt;X HAIR.</p>
<p>Second, we can create tokens, such as &quot;Understand &quot;blonde hair&quot; or &quot;hair&quot; as &quot;[hair]&quot;, and then use these tokens in match phrases. This saves a good deal of time when we want to specify a number of different but fussy alternatives. So, for instance, here is a drawing that would not respond to &gt;X OF, or &gt;X BROWN EYES, but would respond to &gt;X DRAWING OF MAN WITH BROWN EYES, &gt;X MAN WITH BROWN EYES, and so on:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c329_219" -->
<a id="c329_219"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Further refinements are possible: the &quot;privately-named&quot; attribute tells Inform not to try to understand the source name of an object at all, so if we write</p>
<!-- START CODE "c333_219" -->
<a id="c333_219"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...the player will not be able to refer to it as &quot;purple&quot; or &quot;rabbit&quot; or &quot;purple rabbit&quot;.</p>
<p>There are also ways to make names to refer to entire kinds of objects (so &quot;dude&quot; will refer to any man in the game); to specify names that only refer to objects in the plural (so GET PICTURES will pick up several pictures together); to reflect an object's properties (so &quot;red apple&quot; works only as long as the apple is in fact red); or even to refer to the object's relationships to other objects (so &quot;bottle of wine&quot; works only when wine is indeed in the bottle). All these refinements are discussed in the chapter on Understanding.</p>

<p>Suppose we want to offer the player a window he can climb through, instead of a boring ordinary door. Our window will be like a door in that it connects two rooms, appears in both places, and impedes movement when it is shut. But we also want to add that we can look through it and see what lies on the other side; and we further want to understand &quot;climb through window&quot; or &quot;jump through window&quot; as attempts to pass through it.</p>
<p>We'll start by defining a couple of rooms and making the window a door between them.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we have a &quot;bedroom window&quot; object which can be entered. Now, to catch the case where the player types &quot;LOOK THROUGH WINDOW&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c337_23" -->
<a id="c337_23"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of searching the window:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Through the window, you make out [the other side of the window].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The other side of a door is always defined to be the room that we are not currently in when doing the check. When we are in the bedrooom, the other side will be the grassy slope, and vice versa. &quot;Searching&quot; is the action that occurs when the player attempts to LOOK THROUGH something. (To review what grammar gives rise to what actions, we can always consult the Actions portion of the Index.)</p>
<p>Next we want to cover the case where we climb through the window:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c338_23" -->
<a id="c338_23"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of climbing the window:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;try entering the window.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And because &quot;climb window&quot; is understood but &quot;climb THROUGH window&quot; is not, we will have to borrow from the chapter on Understanding to add some new vocabulary to the game (and we'll add Jump too, while we're at it):</p>
<!-- START CODE "c339_23" -->

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now the final piece: Inform will already keep the player from going through a closed window, but it will say &quot;You can't, since the bedroom window is in the way.&quot; This is probably not ideal, so we can replace the instruction thus:</p>

<p>Suppose we want a locked door that can be opened with a key, but is also openable by hand without a key from one side only. We start by defining an ordinary lockable door and the key that controls it:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The next part is going to require that we modify the normal operation of the &quot;lock&quot; command. &quot;Lock&quot; ordinarily requires that the player supply two objects: a thing he wants to unlock, and the key he wants to use on it. The full command is LOCK DOOR WITH THE KEY, and Inform will not accept simply LOCK DOOR as locking.</p>
<p>Therefore, we're going to need to create our own new variant on the lock verb (and the unlock verb, while we're at it). The full procedure for this is laid out in the chapters on Action and Understanding, but here is an example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c354_101" -->
<a id="c354_101"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;lock [something]&quot; as locking keylessly. Locking keylessly is an action applying to one thing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here we've created a new action -- locking something without a key -- and we've told Inform to understand LOCK DOOR as this action, rather than an incomplete command to LOCK DOOR WITH SOMETHING.</p>
<p>Now we add some instructions so that the game will not let us use this keyless unlocking command unless we're in the right place or are properly equipped:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c355_101" -->
<a id="c355_101"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Check locking keylessly:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the noun is not a door, say &quot;[The noun] is not something you can lock.&quot; instead;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the noun is locked, say &quot;[The noun] is already locked.&quot; instead;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player carries the brass key and the player is in the Stairwell, try locking the noun with the brass key instead;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player is in the Stairwell, say &quot;You can't lock the door from this side without the key.&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This check rule is performed before the keyless locking action succeeds. The first thing we do is try to use the key if the player is outside and has the key: this way, LOCK DOOR will turn automatically into LOCK DOOR WITH THE KEY, under circumstances where that is both possible and necessary.</p>
<p>The second thing is to check whether the player is outside but keyless, and, if so stop the action from being performed successfully. Here we print a failure message followed by the word &quot;instead&quot;, which tells Inform that we've substituted some other outcome for the usual performance of the action.</p>
<p>Now we're reasonably sure that the player is only locking keylessly in the case that he is inside the Studio. (We might have to do a more thorough check for this if there were more than two rooms, but as it is, the player can only be in the Stairwell or in the Studio, so if we have ruled out the Stairwell, we are safe.) So now we want to add what happens when locking-without-a-key command succeeds:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c356_101" -->

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That's it. We've just told Inform to make the door be locked. &quot;Now...&quot; syntax will be explained more thoroughly in the chapter on change. But we still haven't described to the player what just happened, so let's provide a description of that, too:</p>

<p>Some (but not all) of this work is done for you if you like by the Locksmith extension. If you prefer, you can include that extension, then follow the documentation in order to implement the remainder of the scenario. Locksmith takes care of implementing the additional locking and unlocking actions, and provides some other conveniences.</p>

<p>Suppose we want to have a room with a light switch. Turning the switch off makes the room go dark; turning it on restores the light. This kind of switch is an obvious candidate as a device.</p>

Terrifying Basement is a room. The light switch is a switched on device in the Terrifying Basement. It is fixed in place.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here we define our light switch, and we also make it start out as &quot;switched on&quot;. The Terrifying Basement will also start out lit (as all rooms do, by default, unless we specifically say that they are dark). We further say that it is fixed in place to avoid the ludicrous possibility of the player picking it up and carrying it away.</p>
<p>Next we add some instructions to control how turning the light switch on and off affects the room light. These borrow from later chapters on actions, but the gist may be obvious anyway:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c367_29" -->
<a id="c367_29"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Carry out switching off the light switch: now the Terrifying Basement is dark.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c368_29" -->
<a id="c368_29"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Carry out switching on the light switch: now the Terrifying Basement is lighted.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform already has the idea of light and darkness built in; we will see more about this later, and the Phrasebook (in the Index tab) also contains a list of all the adjectives (lighted, dark, etc) which are important to use here.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Index, the Actions tab contains a list of all the grammar that can be used to activate a given command: for instance, the switching action responds to &quot;switch [something]&quot; or &quot;turn on [something]&quot;. In this case, we may want to give the player an extra option or two. It would be pretty natural for a player to try &gt;FLIP SWITCH, so let's add that in:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c369_29" -->
<a id="c369_29"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;flip [something switched off]&quot; as switching on. Understand &quot;flip [something switched on]&quot; as switching off. Understand &quot;flip [something]&quot; as switching on.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The nuances of this will be explored in the chapter on Understanding. What is useful to know here is that we have taught Inform to understand that &gt;FLIP LIGHT SWITCH means to turn it on when the switch is already off; if the switch is already on, FLIP SWITCH means to turn the switch off. Depending on the kind of device we are modeling (button? lever? dial?), we might want to write similar lines for commands such as PUSH, PRESS, PULL, TURN, and so on.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to deal with a special case. In general, the player cannot interact with other things in a dark room because he can't see them, but if we adhered strictly to this it would be impossible for him to find the light switch to turn it back on. So we need something from the chapter on Activities to change this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c370_29" -->
<a id="c370_29"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<p>It may not be immediately obvious why we might want to create new intermediate categories of the kinds hierarchy. But there may be times, for instance, where we would like to make an action that applies in the same way to both containers and supporters, but to nothing else in the game. To avoid creating two nearly-identical rules, we would instead roll the two categories together into one, on the principle that duplicating source text is usually a sign of bad design.</p>
<p>So for instance let's say the player is able to zap objects to make them go away, but any contents -- things inside a container or on top of a supporter -- should always be left as residue. Here's one way we might do this:</p>

<div class="egpanel" id="example441">
<p>Wargaming is an ancient pursuit, but its modern form began as a professional training exercise in 19th-century Prussian staff colleges; since at least as early as H. G. Wells's &quot;Little Wars&quot; (1913) it has been a hobby of &quot;boys from twelve years of age to one hundred and fifty and for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys' games and books.&quot; The free-form tabletop game used miniature figures and tape-measured movements, and remains the dominant form today. But in the mid-20th century, map grids on printed sheets gave the hobby a sudden new lease of life. They were easier to set up, more interesting to look at, cheaper to sell by mail-order. 1970s sales figures for &quot;Strategy and Tactics&quot;, the leading US subscription-based wargame distributor, were very similar to those of Infocom's IF games in the 1980s. And like classical IF, the grid-based wargame parceled up a continuous world into locations.</p>
<p>Grids were initially square, as on a chessboard, but square cells have several disadvantages. Four directions of movement (N, E, S, W) is too few, yet allowing movement in the diagonal directions means allowing tanks to travel about 1.4 times faster northeast than they do north. Square grids also only conform cleanly to man-made landscape features such as buildings in one orientation, and they never fit hills well. (A compromise measure to fix this, cutting the squares into octagons to leave smaller diamond squares at corner intersections, has never caught on.)</p>
<p><img alt="hexes.jpg" src="images/hexes.jpg" /></p>
<p>But following Charles S. Roberts's American Civil War designs for Avalon Hill of 1958-61 (notably &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; and the second edition of &quot;Gettysburg&quot;), a hexagonal grid became the new standard. Each hexagon is the same distance from the centre of all six of its neighbours, which are at equal angular spacings; and clumps of hexagons fit the shape of lakes, contoured hills, and so forth, much more naturally than clumps of squares do. Hexes also have a certain mystique - an air of &quot;I don't belong in the children's department&quot;.</p>
<p>But hexes are tricky for IF, not least because English lacks words for &quot;the direction 60 degrees around from front&quot;. Our cognitive view of the world tends to be square, perhaps because our two eyes both face front, in a direction at right angles to the plane of our arms, legs, pelvis and eyes. We reach out sideways at right angles to our walking. Even early hex-grid wargames called the cells &quot;squares&quot;, though &quot;hexes&quot; eventually caught on. Still and all:</p>
