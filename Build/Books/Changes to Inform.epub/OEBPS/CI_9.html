<p>Inform builds projects from both the source text typed by the author and from Extensions; one of these, the Standard Rules, is always included; others are added as authors please. About 20 are &quot;built-in&quot; to Inform, meaning that they are stored inside the application and always available. Others must be &quot;installed&quot;, and each Inform user will have a folder somewhere on his computer which contains these. Users typically download these from inform7.com and then use an Install Extension menu option in the application, which then squirrels the file away. Installed extensions are then available to any projects that user may be working on.</p>
<p>It is now also possible to have extensions available to just one project. These must be stored in the Extensions subfolder of the .materials folder, but otherwise are arranged much the same as installed extensions - there's an outer folder for each author's name, and extensions are named with a &quot;.i7x&quot; extension within. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c286" -->
<a id="c286"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Mourning Hypercritical.inform
<br />Mourning Hypercritical.materials
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Extensions
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Siracusa
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fixing The Finder.i7x
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>When Inform needs to find an extension, it looks here first, then in the installed area, then in its built-in area. That means that you can make your own revised or hacked version of an extension, put it in the .materials area, and then have it take precedence over the installed or built-in one.</p>
<p>We expect this to be useful in several situations: (i) for people who want to have all of their extensions somewhere where a source-control utility like Subversion can conveniently get at them; (ii) for people who want to keep snapshots of extensions as they were at a given point in time; (iii) for people who like to circumvent the Inform application's source editing window and keep all of their source text for a large project in a string of extensions instead; and (iv) for extension authors who want to have an experimental, not-ready-for-release version of their extension to play with in a test project, without disturbing their installed stable version. (See suggestion 751172.)</p>
<p>Extensions are now required to be filenamed with a &quot;.i7x&quot; extension. This was previously usual but not required, and unextended filenames caused problems with the Subversion source control system. (See suggestion 834467.)</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s2"></a>ยง9.2. Releasing</p>
<p>There's a new &quot;release along with&quot; option:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c287" -->
<a id="c287"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Release along with an introductory postcard.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which bundles Andrew Plotkin's IF postcard as part of a release.</p>
<p>(See suggestion 1240511.)</p>
<p>There's also the release option:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c288" -->
<a id="c288"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Release along with the file &quot;filename&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This includes the named file, but without listing it as a browsable item on any generated website. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c289" -->
<a id="c289"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Release along with a file of &quot;Butterfly painting&quot; called &quot;butterfly.jpg&quot;.
<br />Release along with the file &quot;butterfly.jpg&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>do exactly the same thing as each other except that the first lists &quot;Butterfly painting&quot; on the sidebar menu of a released website, and the second doesn't. We can also file it away in a subfolder:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c290" -->
<a id="c290"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Release along with the file &quot;butterfly.jpg&quot; in &quot;hidden_images&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>so that it ends up as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c291" -->
<a id="c291"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Release/hidden_images/butterfly.jpg
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>rather than</p>
<!-- START CODE "c292" -->
<a id="c292"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Release/butterfly.jpg
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The new release options:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c293" -->
<a id="c293"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Release along with Javascript &quot;whatever.js&quot;.
<br />Release along with style sheet &quot;how_may_you.css&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>cause Inform to add inclusions of these scripts (of which there can be any number) to any web page generated in the release; and automatically also achieve the effect of:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c294" -->
<a id="c294"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Release along with the file &quot;whatever.js&quot;.
<br />Release along with the file &quot;how_may_you.css&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>thus copying them into place.</p>
<p>The new release options:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c295" -->
<a id="c295"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Release along with separate figures.
<br />Release along with separate sounds.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>cause any figures or sounds created by the project to be copied into the Release folder explicitly: in fact, to Release/Figures and Release/Sounds respectively. This makes them more accessible to hybrid website/IF projects than if they were only embedded in the Glulx story file, and thus invisible to external Javascript or HTML.</p>
<p>Bibliographic data for a project is now allowed to contain Unicode text substitutions. Thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c296" -->
<a id="c296"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Include Unicode Character Names by Graham Nelson.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c297" -->
<a id="c297"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The story headline is &quot;Adventures in [']68[unicode 8211]79&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c298" -->
<a id="c298"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The story description is &quot;This is a sentence[unicode 8212]with a parenthetical in dashes[unicode 8212]because 8212 is the Unicode number for an em-dash. But for example, 'pawn to [unicode black chess bishop]4' draws in a black chess bishop, so it works with names, too.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(This was absolutely a suggestion, not a bug, in spite of generating bug reports 0000913 and 0000926.)</p>
