<p>The documentation has of course been extended and modified to cover the changes in this new build of Inform, but beyond that:</p>
<p>From this build, the Inform documentation (the manuals &quot;Writing with Inform&quot; and &quot;The Recipe Book&quot;) are released in EPUB format for the first time, and can be read on tablets such as iPads, or in ebook applications such as Apple's iBooks. The documentation HTML, which used to be coded in late-1990s idioms and was difficult to do much with, now passes XHTML 1.1 Strict and uses CSS for styling. (See suggestion 751034.)</p>
<p>A new &quot;General Index&quot; tab in the Documentation pane features an extensive A-Z index, hand-prepared by Andrew Plotkin: it's a refinement of the one he has for some years maintained online, and unlike a mechanical search tool it's based on human understanding of the material.</p>
<p>The other conspicious change is that the contents page for the documentation now presents the two books, Writing With Inform and The Recipe Book, side by side. Informal surveys had suggested that many readers never found the Recipe Book at all: we wanted to change that. New &quot;expand all&quot; buttons make it possible to see the entire detailed contents page at once. (See suggestions 860937 and 783273.)</p>
<p>The PURLOIN testing command is now documented for the first time. (See suggestion 752104.)</p>
<p>The syntax analysis layer in Inform was completely rewritten for this build, and as a side-benefit from that, we are for the first time publishing a complete specification of the language, mechanically generated from the source code for the compiler (along with an extensive commentary).</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s2"></a>ยง6.2. The Index</p>
<p>The Index has been redesigned. It had gradually grown in coverage and depth, build after build, with a variety of designs used to navigate around it. In this build we've bitten the bullet and imposed a new design to recognise that each of the major Index sections (Contents, Actions and so on) has multiple &quot;elements&quot;, and that we have a two-level hierarchy, not one. There's greater use of mouse-over highlighting to advertise links; note the dark grey bar to the left of the section banners, which takes the reader to a new Welcome home page - the so-called &quot;Periodic Table&quot; page, because it shows every element.</p>
<p>We have tried to make each element of the Index a little more detailed and a little clearer visually. For example, the Contents listing itemises how many words of source text fall under each heading. Indexed rules include a new icon which reveals their Responses (see below).</p>
<p>There are far too many changes to itemise, but the following are noted because they arose from Uservoice suggestions:</p>
<p>Command aliases are now indexed in individual actions. (See suggestion 937641.)</p>
<p>The Alphabetical action chart now tabulates requirements on light and nouns. (See suggestion 3265911.)</p>
<p>The Actions detail view now includes persuasion and unsuccessful attempt rules. (See suggestion 884661.)</p>
