<p>This is for the most part a maintenance release of Inform, incorporating fixes for nearly 300 issues reported with the previous build. All bugs reported before 3 September 2015 (and most later ones) have been removed. Fans of bugs need not despair, however, as the code has internally been much rewritten, so new ones will doubtless appear.</p>
<p>A modest selection of minor improvements to the underlying language can be found below, but little is fundamentally altered.</p>
<p>The Mac OS X user interface application sees two new developments in this release. One is the new concept of an &quot;extension project&quot;, intended for writers of Inform extensions, which manages the extension source text better, and can automatically test the extension's examples of usage, which should make maintenance easier. The other development is that the previous Skein and Transcript panels have been merged together into one, simply called Testing, with a much clearer and simpler user interface. As in the past, some of these developments are likely to appear on other platforms in due course, but users should expect this to take a little time.</p>
<p>Many users gave up their time to report bugs in 2014/15, and we're grateful to all of them, but a particular tip of the hat goes to Daniel Fremont, who not only tested many obscure corners of the language but also combed through the documentation for out-of-date usages. It is thanks to Daniel that we learned that repeating the sentence &quot;Foo is a room.&quot; 117030 times would crash the compiler, and that the documentation made what he called &quot;a 300 sextillion kg error in the mass of Jupiter&quot; (in our defence, that makes less difference than you might expect); and, at Daniel's urging, we did indeed &quot;pick a consistent spelling for 'discombobulate'&quot;.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s2"></a>§2.2. Minor new features in the language</p>
<p>* Usage of the &quot;stored action&quot; kind has been streamlined considerably. For one thing, it can now be called simply &quot;action&quot;. As when &quot;indexed text&quot; and &quot;text&quot; became the same thing, so too &quot;action&quot; and &quot;stored action&quot; are now synonymous. Constant actions no longer need to be written using the &quot;action of&quot; phrase, so for example these usages are now legal:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1" -->
<a id="c1"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The best idea yet is an action that varies.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2" -->
<a id="c2"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the best idea yet is pushing the button.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Previously one had to call it a stored action that varies, and one had to say &quot;now the best idea yet is the action of pushing the button&quot;. The &quot;action of...&quot; phrase still exists, to keep old source text working, but it now has the following comically redundant definition in the Standard Rules:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c3" -->
<a id="c3"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To decide what action is the action of (A - action): (- {A} -).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>* In past builds, switch-like ifs were valid only for simpler kinds of value such as numbers; they can now switch on any value, and in particular on texts. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c4" -->
<a id="c4"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the new password text is:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;-- &quot;xyzzy&quot;: say &quot;Nothing happens.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;-- &quot;password&quot;: say &quot;Would you care to accept a position at the NSA?&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;-- otherwise: say &quot;Accepted.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>* Two minor improvements to the handling of named constants, which are relatively new in the language.</p>
<p>(a) The number of blank rows in a table can now be specified using a named constant, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c5" -->
<a id="c5"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The spare capacity is always 10.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c6" -->
<a id="c6"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Table of Stuff
<br />whatever (a number)
<br />with spare capacity blank rows
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The named constant must, of course, hold a non-negative integer. Note that it is allowed to be 0, which adds no blank rows. Inform doesn't allow completely empty tables, so if, as in this case, there are no explicit rows and the name comes out to 0 as well, Inform quietly gives the table a single row of blanks, but does compile it. (See bug report 0001724.)</p>
<p>(b) Map connections can now be made to or from rooms referred to by named constants, not explicitly as usual. Thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7" -->
<a id="c7"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Lounge is a room.
<br />The designated room is always the Lounge.
<br />The Exit Area is east of the designated room.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>places the Exit Area east of the Lounge.</p>
<p>* When one action is converted to another one inside the Standard Rules, as most often happens when &quot;removing X from Y&quot; is converted to &quot;taking X&quot;, and the action then succeeds, the after rulebook for the original action is now followed. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c8" -->
<a id="c8"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Some coins and some bills are in the tip jar.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c9" -->
<a id="c9"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After removing something from the tip jar:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Alice is shocked at your bold impropriety.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will now work as might be expected from its wording. (This was filed as bug report 0001476, but it was really a feature request.)</p>
<p>* A new Understand token &quot;[any things]&quot; is a sort of cross-breed between &quot;[any ...]&quot; and &quot;[things]&quot;, in that it behaves like &quot;[things]&quot; (accepting a multiple object) but with no restriction on scope, that is, applying to anything however distant or invisible, as with &quot;any&quot;. (This was suggestion 751340.)</p>
<p>* A new text substitution for adaptive text:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10" -->
<a id="c10"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
[regarding N]
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>makes it easier to write responses such as the parser error internal rule (Q):</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11" -->
<a id="c11"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[if number understood is 0]None[otherwise]Only [number understood in
<br />words][end if] of those [regarding the number understood][are] available.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which inflects the verb to agree with the number.</p>
<p>* A subtle change to the rules on kind inference: if a temporary value X is created with &quot;let&quot;, in the shape</p>
<!-- START CODE "c12" -->
<a id="c12"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let X be V;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then Inform gives X whatever kind V has - for example, &quot;let X be 10&quot; will make X a number, and so on. Traditionally, though, if V is any kind of object, X has the kind &quot;object&quot;, not something more specific. This is so that sensible-looking source text like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13" -->
<a id="c13"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let X be Peter;
<br />now X is Jane;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...won't cause a problem message. If X is given the kind &quot;man&quot;, the kind of Peter, then the &quot;now&quot; can't be allowed because Jane has kind &quot;woman&quot;. In previous builds, then, Inform gave X the kind &quot;object&quot;.</p>
<p>The change is that it now gives X the right top-level kind of object, instead of &quot;object&quot; itself. In the case of &quot;let X be Peter&quot;, X will now be given the kind &quot;thing&quot;, because Peter has the kind &quot;man&quot;, but man is a kind of person, which is a kind of thing, and thing is a kind of object. More generally, where X would once have been an &quot;object&quot;, it will now be one of &quot;thing&quot;, &quot;room&quot;, &quot;region&quot; or &quot;direction&quot;. This removes a number of small annoyances (see for example bug report 0001501).</p>
<p>* Most phrase definitions are not case sensitive, but an exception is made for text substitutions where there are different definitions depending on whether the first word is capitalised or not. This enables &quot;[the X]&quot; and &quot;[The X]&quot; to have different meanings. In the new build, case sensitivity has been extended to cover all text substitutions whose definition is a single letter. This means that &quot;[S]&quot; will no longer be misread as if it were &quot;[s]&quot;, the notation for an optional &quot;s&quot;; so source text such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c14" -->
<a id="c14"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let S be 10;
<br />say &quot;S is [S].&quot;;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will no longer peculiarly say &quot;S is s.&quot; or &quot;S is .&quot;, but will say &quot;S is 10.&quot; (Prompted by bug report 0001492.)</p>
<p>* In past builds, the adjective &quot;empty&quot; couldn't usefully be applied to relations created in sentences in the usual way; for example, given</p>
<!-- START CODE "c15" -->
<a id="c15"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Noticing relates various people to one person.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>the condition &quot;the noticing relation is empty&quot; and the instruction &quot;now the noticing relation is empty&quot; weren't allowed. They now are. (Prompted by bug report 0001416.)</p>
<p>* A new rulebook has been added:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c16" -->
<a id="c16"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
multiple action processing rules
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This is called when a command would produce a multiple action, such as TAKE ALL. Rules in it can then take the opportunity to look at the list of objects to which the action would apply, and can change or rearrange this.</p>
<p>* &quot;Understand&quot; can now apply to descriptions of values. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c17" -->
<a id="c17"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;glowing&quot; as something lit.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>now works; previously this could only be done with the circumlocution</p>
<!-- START CODE "c18" -->
<a id="c18"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;glowing&quot; as a thing when the item described is lit.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Prompted by bug report 0001796.)</p>
<p>* The following rules have been added to the Standard Rules:</p>
<p>(a) The &quot;describe what's on mentioned supporters in room descriptions rule&quot; improves the look of room descriptions when a non-scenery, non-undescribed supporter is holding up one item that has an initial appearance and another that hasn't, and is for some reason mentioned in that first item's initial appearance; this parallels the existing handling of scenery supporters.</p>
<p>(b) The &quot;exclude indirect possessions from take all rule&quot; means that TAKE ALL won't try to take items which are inside open containers already being carried, and so forth. (See bug report 0001474.)</p>
<p>* The following existing rules in the Standard Rules have changed:</p>
<p>(a) The &quot;standard taking rule&quot; has been extended to add:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c19" -->
<a id="c19"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the actor is the player, now the noun is handled.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This ensures that even items only fleetingly carried are &quot;handled&quot;; in previous builds, a successful taking action might not result in an object being &quot;handled&quot; if it were then lost again before the end of the same turn. (This can happens as a result of implicit takes. See bug report 0001460.)</p>
<p>(b) The &quot;immediately undo rule&quot; has a new response (F) which reports that the interpreter's UNDO capacity has been exhausted. (See bug 0001689.)</p>
<p>(c) The following existing responses in existing rules have been made adaptive (see bug report 0001715). Old and new definitions are as follows -</p>
<!-- START CODE "c20" -->
<a id="c20"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
basic visibility rule response (A)
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.&quot;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;[It] [are] pitch dark, and [we] [can't see] a thing.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c21" -->
<a id="c21"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
block climbing rule response (A)
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;I don't think much is to be achieved by that.&quot;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;Little [are] to be achieved by that.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c22" -->
<a id="c22"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
parser nothing error internal rule response (B)
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;There are none at all available!&quot;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;[There] [adapt the verb are from the third person plural] none
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;at all available!&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(d) The &quot;announce items from multiple object lists rule&quot; now has a new response (A), which is responsible for the traditional format of the text dividing up replies relating to different objects (see bug report 0001762). This has the value</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23" -->
<a id="c23"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[current item from the multiple object list]: [run paragraph on]&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and is responsible for e.g. &quot;yellow marble: &quot; and &quot;red marble: &quot; in -</p>
<!-- START CODE "c24" -->
<a id="c24"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
yellow marble: Taken.
<br />red marble: Taken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Being a response, it's now customisable. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c25" -->
<a id="c25"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The announce items from multiple object lists rule response (A) is &quot;[current
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>action]: [run paragraph on]&quot;.</p>
<p>leads to</p>
<!-- START CODE "c26" -->
<a id="c26"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
taking the yellow marble: Taken.
<br />taking the red marble: Taken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>* The implementation of integer square root and cube root has been improved, so that Glulx's floating-point operations are used if available. This is faster and normally more accurate. (See bug report 0001547.)</p>
<p>* When releasing with an existing story file, this file can now be named:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c27" -->
<a id="c27"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Release along with an existing story file called &quot;Zork1_sg.z5&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Previously it had to be &quot;Story.z8&quot;.)</p>
<p>* A clarification: a list is sayable if and only if its contents are sayable. In previous builds lists were always sayable, but would produce meaningless output if the contents weren't sayable (for example, for a list of topics).</p>
<p>* A clarification: creating kinds of direction is not allowed, and it now produces a problem message rather than failing more obscurely. (See bug 0001588.)</p>
<p>* A clarification: in past builds the documentation said that literal patterns could contain up to 4 parts; internally, the limit was 16, but would not always work correctly for high values; the limit is now set at 8.</p>
<p>* The &quot;phrase&quot; token works differently. This was undocumented and unsupported, and was to have been removed entirely in this build; but the extension &quot;Hypothetical Questions by Jesse McGrew&quot; turned out to use it regardless of its unofficial status, and the popular &quot;Consolidated Multiple Actions by John Clemens&quot; made use of this in turn. We have therefore retained it, a little reluctantly. Even so, its use has been somewhat restricted: it can't accept control constructs such as if, while, repeat, otherwise, now, or say. On the other hand it expands in a more predictable fashion, without generating braces which are problematic to deal with. It nevertheless remains an unsupported feature of Inform, and there's no guarantee it won't change.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s3"></a>§2.3. Inform for Mac OS X</p>
<p>Firstly, the Mac OS X application has made the transition to 64 bit only. This change only adversely affects users who are still running OS X 10.6.8 on 32 bit hardware. Users of Inform on OS X 10.7 and above are still fully compatible (because by definition they are already running on 64 bit hardware). Similarly, users still running OS X 10.6.8 on 64 bit hardware should remain compatible. This change is made to help improve stability and smooth future development.</p>
<p>New to this version is the Testing panel (which replaces the old Skein and Transcript panels of previous versions). The Testing panel is designed to help ensure the story consistently responds as expected while the development of the source continues. The Testing panel consists of ‘knots’ - all commands that have on previous occasions been played in the story with their associated response text. Knots are displayed in a branching fashion - knots lower down the panel are later in the story than those nearer the top. Each knot’s response text can be ticked (‘blessed’) to signify that it is correct (i.e. as expected). Any deviation from the blessed text in future plays of the story will be shown on the knot with a red star, and the differences highlighted in the response text itself. Each knot has a menu of options. Knots can be dragged and dropped onto other knots to be copied or moved, even onto other projects. Undo is supported. A Help section of the Testing panel describes each element. The Play All button allows all knots to be automatically played in the story.</p>
<p>Also new to this version are Extension Projects. Extension Projects are designed to help developers of Inform extensions. An Extension Project can be created from an existing extension or from scratch. The extension’s source can be edited, its ‘examples of use' played and tested individually, or all its examples tested automatically. The extension can then be installed or exported as required.</p>
<p>A smaller improvement is that the story is now only recompiled on ‘Go!' if needed, for example because its source text has changed.</p>

<p>Bug fixed - or really, convention changed (0001586) - so that if a room is made using &quot;X is D of Y&quot;, where D is a direction with no reverse, then X is assumed likely to be a room in the absence of other evidence. Previously this happened only if D had a reverse. (This was because the convention was that assumptions were made only about the destination Y: when D had a reverse direction, un-D, the above sentence implied also &quot;Y is un-D of X&quot;, and so X was also a destination.)</p>

<p>Bug fixed (0001603) whereby an item marked &quot;undescribed&quot; would nevertheless be described if it both provided an initial appearance text and was found on a supporter. (See the &quot;initial appearance on supporters rule&quot;.)</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001493) whereby an item hidden through the use of the &quot;deciding the concealed possessions of&quot; activity would nevertheless be mentioned in the bracketed part of a list of objects, as in, &quot;You can see an aquarium (in which are some pebbles and a goldfish) here.&quot;: in previous builds the pebbles would have been included even if the activity had said otherwise.</p>
