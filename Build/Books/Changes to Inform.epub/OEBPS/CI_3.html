<p>Unlike its predecessor, build 6L02, this release of Inform is aimed almost entirely at maintenance: it fixes around 150 bugs, most of them minor and related to recent changes. Users of 6L02 should be able to upgrade with no preparation needed; users of earlier builds, though, would be well advised to read the notes on the big changes in 6L02 before proceeding.</p>
<p>But there is one major development, all the same: for the first time Inform is released for a mass-market mobile operating system - Android.</p>
<hr />
<!-- START IGNORE -->
<!-- END IGNORE -->
<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s2"></a>§3.2. Minor new features in the language</p>
<p>It was realised soon after the release of 6L02 that the text substitutions &quot;[those]&quot; and &quot;[Those]&quot; were ambiguous, since if they're applied to an object which is a man or woman then they would have to be different in the accusative and nominative cases. Consider the two texts:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c28" -->
<a id="c28"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;But [we] [aren't] holding [regarding the noun][those].&quot;
<br />&quot;But [regarding the noun][those] [aren't] available.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and suppose the noun is Andrew. Then &quot;[those]&quot; needs to expand as &quot;him&quot; in the first case but as &quot;he&quot; in the second. To distinguish these,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c29" -->
<a id="c29"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[those in the nominative]&quot;
<br />&quot;[those in the accusative]&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and similarly for Those. But what should plain &quot;[those]&quot; and &quot;[Those]&quot; do? We note that the Standard Rules used &quot;[those]&quot; in 7 responses, all accusative, and &quot;[Those]&quot; in a further 12, all nominative. Accordingly, Inform now defines &quot;[those]&quot; as equivalent to &quot;[those in the accusative]&quot; and &quot;[Those]&quot; as &quot;[Those in the nominative]&quot;. This fixes bug 0001232, and though it's not a perfect solution, it's intended to be something we might revisit when Inform has a better idea of noun cases (as it will need for, say, adaptive German). Note that &quot;nominative&quot; and &quot;accusative&quot; are the two values of the kind &quot;grammatical case&quot;; &quot;nominative&quot; existed in 6L02, but &quot;accusative&quot; is new in this build.</p>
<p>The real square root function can now be applied to any numerical quantity for which the dimensions (in physics terms) are a perfect square. Thus, if we're using the Metric Units extension,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c30" -->
<a id="c30"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the real square root of 4 sq m
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>produces the length &quot;2.0m&quot;. This also means that equations such as:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c31" -->
<a id="c31"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Equation - Pythagoras's Theorem
<br />a = root (b^2+c^2)
<br />where a is a length, b is a length, c is a length.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>can be solved for &quot;a&quot;; this previously failed because &quot;root&quot; could be applied only to dimensionless numbers. (See also bug report 0001264.)</p>
<p>The following are now equivalent:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c32" -->
<a id="c32"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
[1] A food is a kind of thing which is edible.
<br />[2] A food is a kind of edible thing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Previously [1] was allowed, but [2] was disallowed.)</p>
<p>Action descriptions like the following are now rejected:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c33" -->
<a id="c33"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of taking seven things: ...
<br />Instead of taking the teddy bear on the dresser: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The first case is rejected because a single noun can't be &quot;seven things&quot;, and the second because &quot;the teddy bear&quot;, a proper noun, is being used as if it were a common noun. (&quot;a thing on the dresser&quot; would be fine.) Previous builds of Inform allowed these, but compiled misleading tests: e.g. the latter would simply test whether the teddy bear was on the dresser, regardless of whether or not it was the thing taken.</p>
<p>It is now officially illegal to create something new with one of the following reserved names:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c34" -->
<a id="c34"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
action, condition, list-entry, now-condition, phrase, property-value, storage, table-reference, variable
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These all have internal meanings and it's unlikely to be safe to create anything with these names, though in some cases one might be lucky. (The example &quot;Greater Variety&quot;, for instance, created a table column named &quot;action&quot; in 6L02 and got away with it; this column has been renamed. See bug report 0001347.)</p>
<p>It is now officially illegal to define a phrase which looks like &quot;X is (a relationship) Y&quot;. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c35" -->
<a id="c35"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To decide whether (X - testval) is less than (Y - testval):
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is now disallowed, because there's already a meaning of &quot;To be less than&quot;. (See bug report 0001230.)</p>
<p>When replacing a heading from an extension, it is now possible to put the heading name in quotation marks for clarity. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c36" -->
<a id="c36"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Section - Another Questions fix (in place of &quot;Section 4 - Phrase used to ask questions in closed mode&quot; in Questions by Michael Callaghan)
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Without quotation marks, the grammar is ambiguous, because of the &quot;in&quot; in the name of the heading. See bug report 0001239.)</p>
<p>It's now legal to test actions against kinds of actions in a more flexible way. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c37" -->
<a id="c37"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Attacking is aggressive behaviour. Examining is inquisitive behaviour.
<br />[1] Before aggressive behaviour: ...
<br />[2] Before doing something other than aggressive behaviour: ...
<br />[3] Before aggressive behaviour or inquisitive behaviour: ...
<br />[4] Before aggressive behaviour or jumping: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Previously only rule [1] would have been allowed. (This was prompted by bug report 0001244, though that was arguably a suggestion in disguise.)</p>
<p>The &quot;backtrace&quot; problem messages arising from ambiguous possible phrases, which list what Inform was trying to read, have been redesigned a little.</p>
<p>The default contents of the following two responses have changed:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c38" -->
<a id="c38"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
list writer internal rule response (R)
<br />list writer internal rule response (T)
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>in each case to remove an open bracket at the beginning; this open bracket is instead displayed using list writer internal rule response (A) first. The practical effect of this is that only two changes are needed to make the list writer always use, say, square brackets instead of round ones:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c39" -->
<a id="c39"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The list writer internal rule response (A) is &quot; [bracket]&quot;.
<br />The list writer internal rule response (B) is &quot;[close bracket]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(See bug report 0001344, to which this is related.)</p>
<p>I6 template files can now be installed in Inform's external resources folder, in a subfolder called &quot;I6T&quot;. Inform first looks for these in Project.materials/I6T, then in (external)/I6T, and lastly in its own built-in reservoir. This is a change nobody actually asked for, but it makes everything consistent since the same convention is followed for Language bundles, website Templates and Extensions.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s3"></a>§3.3. Inform for Mac OS X</p>
<p>6L02 introduced an almost entirely rewritten user interface, and inevitably there were a few bugs: the Installed Extensions list redrew awkwardly, flashing content (0001238); entering full screen mode could leave the Find dialog stranded behind (0001252); save panels from the Welcome window were not sufficiently explanatory (0001273); clicking on extension names to bring up their documentation worked badly (0001237); unchecking the &quot;bind up into a Blorb file on release&quot; option on the Settings pane had no effect (0001306); Inform crashed on launch under Snow Leopard (0001271); IFIDs were not persistent, defeating their purpose (0001278); headings at the top of the source text were not correctly rendered on screen (0001331). These are all fixed.</p>

<!-- END IGNORE -->
<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s4"></a>§3.4. Inform for Windows</p>
<p>A new option, &quot;Generate Inform 6 debugging information&quot;, has been added to the preferences dialog. This option controls whether the command line used to run Inform 6 specifies that the debugging output file should be created, and defaults to &quot;off&quot;.</p>
<p>The Extensions tab is now implemented, providing access to the Public Library.</p>
<p>&quot;Create new project&quot; buttons are present in the documentation, next to example projects.</p>
<p>The elastic tab-stops option is now &quot;Auto-space table columns&quot; in the preferences dialog, to match better how things work on OS X.</p>
<p>Bugs 0000210 and 0001362 have been fixed.</p>

<p>For the first time, this build of Inform is available for Android: specifically, for Android 2.1 (Eclair) or later.</p>
<p>[Chapter: Maintenance in build 6L38]</p>
<p>Around 100 bug fixes are made in this build, and once again all known issues have been resolved.</p>
<p>The following lists only the more significant bug fixes: it excludes those categorised by the bug tracker as &quot;cosmetic&quot;, mostly small improvements to problem messages, or which affect only the documentation. I'm nevertheless grateful to all those who submitted these bugs, and in particular this build benefits from reports 0001229, 0001234, 0001246, 0001251, 0001259, 0001262, 0001263, 0001281, 0001289, 0001295, 0001299, 0001303, 0001308, 0001311, 0001316, 0001318, 0001321, 0001324, 0001327, 0001333, 0001334, 0001341, 0001342, 0001345, 0001352, 0001388.</p>
<p>(A special mention to 0001336 and 0001337 for some close proof-reading of the manuals, and another to 0001275 for pointing out that we confused the Swedish country code (SE) with its language code (SV) when putting together icons to indicate the language of play, which resulted in the flag of San Salvador making an appearance.)</p>

<p>Bug fixed (0001373) whereby &quot;The Attic is above the Parlor&quot; would work, but &quot;The Attic is a room above the Parlor&quot; would make a connection the wrong way (up from the Attic to the Parlor rather than vice versa).</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001290) whereby some attempts to make map connections to constant values which aren't objects would be ignored (which is fair enough) but with no problem message (which isn't).</p>

<p>Bug fixed (0001365) whereby grouping items under a given text would not always work if that text included substitutions. It now does, and automatically performs the substitution at grouping time.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001344) whereby two oddball cases in the list-writer printed a close round bracket &quot;)&quot; directly, rather than printing it with the list writer internal rule response (B).</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001283) whereby the past tenses of regular English verbs ending -ay, -ey or -oy were incorrect: thus play was plaied, annoy was annoied, and so forth.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001396) to do with capitalising &quot;ÿ&quot; in the Z-machine (Queensrÿche fans, beware).</p>

<p>Bug fixed (0001300) whereby the text &quot;This text is not actually used&quot; is actually used in the Actions detail view.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001335) whereby the adjective &quot;substituted&quot; was wrongly defined in the Lexicon index.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001332) whereby the Contents index was miscounting the number of words under some headings.</p>

<p>Bug fixed (0001256) whereby the RESPONSES testing command would list responses from some extensions in more than one numbered chunk.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001236) whereby run-time problem messages would sometimes be hidden on screen if they occurred during the expansion of a text substitution.</p>

<p>Bug fixed (0001293) to make HTML generated by cBlorb slightly better at passing validators.</p>
<p>Bug fixed (0001253) whereby releasing along with the &quot;introductory booklet&quot; or &quot;introductory postcard&quot; had stopped working.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s22"></a>§3.22. Extension maintenance</p>
<p>Glulx Text Effects by Emily Short (now maintained by Dannii Willis) has been updated to give comprehensive support for all Glk text features, and to simplify how colours are set, by using web (CSS) colours like #8800FF. See the extension documentation for more details. An issue to do with deprecated phrases in the examples has been resolved (see 0001367). This update is not fully backwards compatible, but any changes will be easy to make.</p>
<p>Metric Units: removed documentation references to the limitations which existed before we switched to floating-point arithmetic in 6L02.</p>
<p>Epistemology by Eric Eve: Updated to version 8. This fixes a bug (which has oddly only just come to light after all this time, unless it’s a by-product of 6L02) by which backdrops weren’t being marked as seen. It also adds an (A) to label the response of the report epistemic status rule.</p>

<p class="sectionheading"><a id="s23"></a>§3.23. Examples maintenance</p>
<p>Examples in the documentation which contained ampersands now paste correctly into the source panel (see 0001312).</p>
<p>Small revisions have been made to the examples Lethal Concentration 1 and 2 (see 0001341), Persephone (see 0001346), Terror of the Sierra Madre (0001340), Olfactory Settings (see 0001305).</p>
<p>The example &quot;Lollipop Guild&quot; has been rewritten to demonstrate removing implicit takes from a different action (since eating no longer mandates these); and it is more dentist-friendly into the bargain.</p>
<p>The tiny example &quot;We&quot; has been removed: responses and adaptive text have overtaken it (see 0001245).</p>
<p>The example &quot;Greater Variety&quot; has been renamed &quot;Variety 2&quot; to emphasise its sequelness (see 0001284).</p>
